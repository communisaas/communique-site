## Executive Summary

**Phase 1 = MVP:** We're building the complete cryptographic system as specified in voter-protocol/ARCHITECTURE.md. No compromises, no reduced-feature launch.

**What We're Building (All Non-Negotiable):**

- **Halo2 zero-knowledge district proofs** (4-6 seconds in browser, no trusted setup)
- **Identity verification** (self.xyz + Didit.me, FREE, Sybil resistance)
- **3-layer content moderation** (OpenAI + Gemini/Claude consensus)
- **Encrypted message delivery** (XChaCha20-Poly1305 ‚Üí AWS Nitro Enclaves on ARM Graviton ‚Üí CWC API)
- **On-chain reputation** (ERC-8004 on Scroll L2, read-only queries)
- **Congressional dashboard** (free for offices, reputation filtering)

**Parallel Development Model:**

- **This repo (communique):** Frontend application, handled by this Claude instance
- **voter-protocol repo:** Halo2 circuits, smart contracts, SDK, handled by separate Claude instance
- **Sync points clearly marked below** when communique depends on voter-protocol deliverables

**What's Different from Old Architecture:**

- ‚ùå **NO** hybrid GKR+SNARK (replaced with Halo2 recursive proofs)
- ‚ùå **NO** NEAR CipherVault encrypted PII storage (addresses never stored anywhere)
- ‚ùå **NO** database storage of addresses or district hashes
- ‚úÖ **YES** client-side only ZK proof generation (addresses never leave browser)
- ‚úÖ **YES** Halo2 is 2x faster (4-6s vs 8-12s) and 50% cheaper (60-100k gas vs 80-120k)

## Implementation Strategy: 3 Phases (12-16 Weeks Total)

### Phase A: Foundation (Weeks 1-4) - ~75% COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Goal:** Build foundational features that don't depend on voter-protocol

**Week 1-2: Content Moderation + Identity Verification** - ‚úÖ MOSTLY COMPLETE

- [x] ‚úÖ OpenAI Moderation API integration (FREE tier) - COMPLETE
- [x] ‚úÖ Template moderation pipeline (auto-reject illegal content) - COMPLETE
- [x] ‚úÖ self.xyz SDK integration (NFC passport verification) - COMPLETE
- [ ] ‚è≥ Didit.me fallback integration (government ID) - 2 days remaining
- [ ] ‚è≥ Sybil resistance (identity hash checking) - 1 day remaining

**Week 3-4: Database Schema Cleanup + Test Coverage** - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [x] ‚úÖ Template CRUD integration tests - COMPLETE (447 test lines)
- [ ] ‚è≥ Identity verification E2E tests - 50% complete
- [x] ‚úÖ CWC delivery integration tests - COMPLETE

**Deliverables:**

- ‚è≥ Users can verify identity via NFC passport or government ID - 70% (self.xyz ‚úÖ, Didit.me ‚è≥)
- ‚úÖ Templates auto-moderated for illegal content - COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Database stores ZERO PII (only metadata) - COMPLETE
- ‚è≥ 80%+ test coverage on core flows - 65% (good foundation, needs identity E2E tests)

**üîÑ SYNC POINT A (End of Week 4):**
Check with voter-protocol Claude instance on Halo2 circuit progress. No blockers yet‚Äîcommunique can continue independently.

---

### Phase B: Cryptography (Weeks 5-12) - Full Phase 1 Core

**Goal:** Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs + blockchain reputation

**Week 5-8: Halo2 Implementation (voter-protocol repo)**

- [ ] Implement Halo2 Merkle membership circuit (Rust)
- [ ] Shadow Atlas Merkle tree construction (congressional districts)
- [ ] Build WASM wrapper for browser proving
- [ ] Test 4-6 second proving time on commodity hardware
- [ ] Deploy DistrictGate.sol verifier on Scroll L2 testnet

**üîÑ SYNC POINT B (End of Week 8):**
**CRITICAL BLOCKER:** communique CANNOT proceed to Week 9-10 browser integration until voter-protocol delivers:

- `@voter-protocol/crypto` NPM package (WASM prover, 4-6s proving time verified)
- `@voter-protocol/client` NPM package (blockchain client SDK)
- Shadow Atlas Merkle tree published (congressional districts)
- DistrictGate.sol deployed on Scroll L2 testnet (proof verification contract)

Without these deliverables, communique cannot integrate Halo2 proof generation.

**Week 9-10: Halo2 Browser Integration (communique repo)**

- [ ] Create `src/lib/core/crypto/halo2-prover.ts`
- [ ] Browser-based proof generation (WASM module)
- [ ] UI progress indicator (4-6s proving time)
- [ ] Integration with address collection flow
- [ ] E2E test: proof generation ‚Üí on-chain verification

**Week 11-12: Blockchain Reputation (Read-Only)** - ‚è≥ 40% COMPLETE

- [x] ‚úÖ `src/lib/core/blockchain/voter-client.ts` exists - COMPLETE (file present, runtime work in progress by separate agent)
- [ ] ‚è≥ ERC-8004 reputation queries (Scroll L2) - Blocked on smart contract deployment
- [ ] ‚è≥ Reputation display in user profiles - UI ready, needs SDK wiring
- [ ] ‚è≥ Include reputation metadata in CWC submissions - Needs SDK integration
- [ ] ‚è≥ Congressional dashboard sees reputation scores - Blocked on dashboard routes

**Note:** Blockchain client runtime implementation being handled by separate agent (as confirmed by user)

**üîÑ SYNC POINT C (End of Week 12):**
Verify with voter-protocol Claude instance:

- ERC-8004 reputation contract deployed on Scroll L2 (mainnet or testnet)
- RPC endpoints accessible for read-only queries
- Reputation scores accumulating correctly on-chain

Phase C can proceed with basic reputation display even if full token economics aren't ready (Phase 2 feature).

**Deliverables:**

- ‚úÖ Browser generates Halo2 proofs in 4-6 seconds
- ‚úÖ Addresses NEVER leave browser, NEVER stored anywhere
- ‚úÖ Congressional offices verify proofs on-chain
- ‚úÖ On-chain reputation visible to users + offices

---

### Phase C: Advanced Features (Weeks 13-16) - Full Phase 1 Complete

**Goal:** Encrypted delivery + congressional dashboard

**Week 13-14: Encrypted Delivery (AWS Nitro Enclaves)** - ‚úÖ 80% COMPLETE

- [x] ‚úÖ XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption utilities - COMPLETE (ready for integration)
- [x] ‚úÖ AWS Nitro Enclaves provider implementation - COMPLETE (776 lines in src/lib/core/tee/providers/aws.ts)
- [x] ‚úÖ CBOR attestation document verification - COMPLETE (PCR validation functional)
- [ ] ‚è≥ Production AWS SDK integration - 20% remaining (replace TODO comments)
- [ ] ‚è≥ Encrypted CWC submission pipeline - Needs production deployment
- [ ] ‚è≥ E2E test: plaintext never leaves enclave - Needs production instance

**Migration Complete:** GCP Confidential Space ‚Üí AWS Nitro Enclaves migration finished (Oct 22, 2025). See docs/development/aws-nitro-migration-complete.md for details.

**Security Note:** AWS Nitro avoids x86 management engines (Intel ME, AMD PSP) but relies on AWS hypervisor trust. While independently audited (Aug 2025), absolute certainty about NSA backdoors is impossible. ARM architecture reduces but doesn't eliminate state-actor risk.

**Week 15: Congressional Dashboard** - ‚ùå NOT STARTED (2-3 weeks work)

- [ ] ‚ùå Congressional email authentication (.senate.gov / .house.gov) - Not started
- [ ] ‚ùå Congressional-facing routes (/dashboard/congress/*) - Not started
- [ ] ‚ùå Message queue with reputation filters - Not started
- [ ] ‚ùå Geographic clustering visualization - Not started
- [ ] ‚ùå Template adoption metrics - Not started
- [ ] ‚ùå Impact tracking (template ‚Üí bill correlation) - Not started

**Note:** This is the largest remaining piece of work. Can be started independently (no voter-protocol dependency). Estimated 2-3 weeks for full implementation.

**Week 16: Security Audit + Launch Prep**

- [ ] Smart contract audit (basic security review)
- [ ] Penetration testing on encryption flow
- [ ] Load testing (1000 concurrent users)
- [ ] Congressional pilot program (3-5 offices)
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance verification

**üîÑ SYNC POINT D (End of Week 16):**
**FINAL PRE-LAUNCH SYNC:** Coordinate with voter-protocol Claude instance for production deployment:

- Smart contract audit results from voter-protocol repo
- Mainnet deployment readiness (Scroll L2 contracts)
- Gas cost estimates verified for production load
- Shadow Atlas Merkle tree finalized with latest congressional district data

Both repos must be production-ready before Phase 1 launch.

**Deliverables:**

- ‚úÖ Messages encrypted end-to-end (browser ‚Üí TEE ‚Üí CWC)
- ‚úÖ Congressional dashboard filtering high-reputation constituents
- ‚úÖ Production-ready Phase 1 system
- ‚úÖ Security audit complete, vulnerabilities addressed

---

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk: Halo2 SDK Maturity

**Risk:** Halo2 is production-grade (Zcash since 2022), but district proof circuits need custom implementation

**Mitigation:**

- Week 5: Evaluate if Halo2 Merkle circuit can achieve 4-6s proving
- Contingency: Use Groth16 SNARKs (well-established, requires trusted setup)
- Decision Point: End of Week 6 - GO/NO-GO on Halo2

### üü° Medium Risk: AWS Nitro Enclaves Complexity

**Risk:** CBOR attestation + enclave image format may cause delays

**Mitigation:**

- Cloud-agnostic abstraction layer allows fallback to GCP/Azure if AWS blocks
- Fallback: Ship Phase 1 without TEE encryption (accept reduced privacy)
- Decision Point: End of Week 14 - Defer TEE to post-launch if blocked

**Security Uncertainty:** While AWS Nitro avoids Intel ME/AMD PSP, we cannot guarantee absence of NSA backdoors in AWS infrastructure. ARM architecture and independent audits (Aug 2025) reduce but don't eliminate risk.

### üü¢ Low Risk: Congressional Adoption

**Risk:** Offices may not use dashboard

**Mitigation:**

- Week 13: Begin congressional outreach (parallel to dev)
- Pilot program: Free white-glove onboarding for first 5 offices
- User research: Weekly calls with LC staff during development

---
