- **Community adoption**: User education, incentive alignment
- **Platform dependencies**: Vendor diversification, open-source alternatives

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 1 implementation** (4 weeks)
2. **Deploy to testnet** with limited user base
3. **Gather feedback** and iterate on UX/performance
4. **Scale testing** with synthetic load
5. **Begin Phase 2 development** while Phase 1 stabilizes
6. **Prepare mainnet deployment** with full VOTER Protocol integration

This roadmap ensures VOTER Protocol's template processing system becomes the gold standard for AI-mediated democratic participation while maintaining decentralization, transparency, and economic sustainability.
