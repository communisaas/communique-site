# Svelte Guidelines

## Component Structure

-   Keep your components small and focused on a single responsibility.
-   The script block should be at the top of the file, followed by the markup, and then the style block.
-   Use `lang="ts"` in your script blocks for TypeScript support.

## State Management

-   For simple component state, use reactive statements (`$:`).
-   For more complex state that needs to be shared across components, use Svelte stores. Define stores in the `src/lib/stores` directory.

## Styling

-   Scope styles to the component by using the `<style>` block without any modifiers.
-   If you need to use global styles, add them to `src/app.css`.

## Accessibility

-   Ensure all interactive elements are accessible. Use ARIA attributes where necessary.
-   Use the `svelte-check` package to help identify accessibility issues.
