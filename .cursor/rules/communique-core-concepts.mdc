# Core Communique Concept: Dual Delivery Channels

The Communique platform has two primary message delivery channels that are triggered from the same `mailto:` interaction design. It is critical to understand the distinction between them when working on any feature related to message templates, creation, or sending.

The delivery channel is determined by `context.channelId`. The UI and logic, particularly in components like `MessageEditor.svelte`, often use a reactive variable `isCongressional` which is true when `context.channelId === 'certified'`.

## 1. Congressional Delivery (`channelId: 'certified'`)

This is for formal communication from a constituent to their elected representative. It has specific requirements and personalization variables.

-   **Purpose**: To allow users to easily contact their members of congress.
-   **Key Variable**: `[Representative Name]`. This is a special variable that is automatically populated based on the sender's congressional district, which is looked up from their address.
-   **Available Variables**:
    -   `[Representative Name]` (Auto-filled)
    -   `[Name]` (Auto-filled from user profile)
    -   `[Address]` (Auto-filled from user profile)
    -   `[Personal Story]`
    -   `[Personal Reasoning]`
-   **Required Variables**: `[Representative Name]`, `[Name]`, `[Address]` must be present in the template.

## 2. Direct Delivery (any `channelId` other than 'certified')

This is a general-purpose channel for less formal communication.

-   **Purpose**: General messaging, not necessarily to a political figure.
-   **Available Variables**:
    -   `[Name]` (Auto-filled from user profile)
    -   `[Address]` (Auto-filled from user profile)
    -   `[Personal Story]`
    -   `[Personal Reasoning]`
-   **Required Variables**: `[Name]`, `[Address]` must be present in the template.

## **Instruction for AI**

When generating or modifying any code, **you must first determine which delivery channel is relevant**. Always check for conditional logic based on `isCongressional` or `context.channelId`. The distinction between these two channels is fundamental to the Communique project.
