# Prisma Guidelines

## Schema

-   When making changes to the `schema.prisma` file, ensure you are using the correct data types for your models.
-   Keep the schema organized and readable. Add comments to explain complex relations or fields.

## Migrations

-   Always generate a new migration after changing the schema. Do not manually edit the SQL in migration files unless absolutely necessary.
-   Use descriptive names for your migrations so it's easy to understand what each migration does.

## Client

-   Use the generated Prisma client for all database interactions.
-   Avoid writing raw SQL queries unless there is no other way to achieve the desired result.
-   Make sure to handle potential errors from database operations gracefully.
