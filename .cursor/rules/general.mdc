# General Guidelines

## About the Project

Communique is a SvelteKit application using TypeScript, Prisma for the database ORM, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Playwright for e2e testing. The goal of the project is to provide a platform for constituents to easily communicate with their elected representatives.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Branching**: Create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix. Branch names should be descriptive, e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication` or `fix/header-layout-issue`.
2.  **Commits**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: add user login page`, `fix: correct typo in hero section`).
3.  **Pull Requests**: Before merging, pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other team member. The PR description should clearly explain the changes and why they were made.
4.  **Testing**: Before submitting a pull request, ensure all existing tests are passing. If you are adding a new feature, please add corresponding tests. Run tests using `npm test`.

## Coding Style

-   Follow the existing coding style.
-   Use Prettier for code formatting. Run `npm run format` before committing.
-   Use the ESLint for linting. Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors.
-   Write clear and descriptive comments where necessary, but avoid over-commenting obvious code.

## Prisma

-   When you change the `schema.prisma` file, run `npx prisma generate` to update the Prisma client.
-   To create a new migration, run `npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>`.
-   Use `npx prisma db push` for schema prototyping (not for production).

## SvelteKit

-   Use `.svelte` files for components.
-   Routes are defined in the `src/routes` directory.
-   For server-side logic, use `+page.server.ts` or `+layout.server.ts`.

## Tailwind CSS

-   Use utility classes from Tailwind CSS for styling.
-   For custom styles, use the `tailwind.config.js` file.

Remember to always keep the user experience in mind and to write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code.
