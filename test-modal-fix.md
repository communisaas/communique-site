# Modal Fix Test Results

## Changes Made

### 1. UnifiedTemplateModal Component
- Modified `open()` method to use `modalStore.open()` directly instead of waiting for component reference
- This fixes the chicken-egg problem where the modal component only renders when `isOpen`, but we needed the component to call `open()`

### 2. Share Link Page (`/src/routes/s/[slug]/+page.svelte`)
- Updated all instances of `modalActions.open(template, data.user)` to use `templateModalStore.open({ template, user: data.user })`
- This ensures we're using the reactive store pattern consistently

### 3. Locations Fixed
- Line 83: `onMount` handler for authenticated users
- Line 96: `handlePostAuthFlow` function
- Line 136: `handleAddressSubmit` success path
- Line 149: `handleAddressSubmit` error path
- Line 310: TemplatePreview's `onSendMessage` (tier 1 channel)
- Line 322: TemplatePreview's `onSendMessage` (US/certified)

## Testing Steps

1. **Test Share Link Landing (Authenticated)**
   - Visit a share link like `/s/climate-action` while logged in
   - Expected: Loading modal should appear immediately
   - Expected: Mailto link should launch after delay
   - Expected: Modal should transition to "Welcome back" state when returning to page

2. **Test Share Link Landing (Unauthenticated)**
   - Visit a share link while logged out
   - Click "Send Message"
   - Expected: Auth modal should appear
   - After auth, expected: Loading modal should appear and mailto should launch

3. **Test Homepage Functionality**
   - Visit homepage and click "Send" on any template
   - Expected: Same modal behavior as share link

## Key Fix
The main issue was that `templateModal?.open()` was being called before the component mounted. By using `templateModalStore.open()` directly, we bypass the component reference and work directly with the reactive store, which can queue the modal to open even before the component exists.
