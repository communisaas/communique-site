**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Context**: Expanding beyond government/landlords to ALL decision-making bodies that affect communities
**Purpose**: Map every power structure where cryptographic organizing tools could create accountability

---

## Initial Research Complete: What We Found

From preliminary web searches, here's the landscape of power structures affecting communities:

### 1. Housing & Real Estate (MASSIVE CONSOLIDATION)
- **Private equity landlords**: 10 largest firms control massive portfolios
- **HOAs**: 24.8M homes, 62M residents governed by undemocratic boards
- **Property management companies**: Often shield beneficial owners
- **RealPage algorithmic pricing**: Criminal DOJ investigation (collusion/price-fixing)
- **DFW consolidation**: 10 homebuilders control 60.8% of new home sales

### 2. Workplace Power
- **Corporate boards**: Shareholder activism growing, but worker voice minimal
- **Labor unions**: Strategic Organizing Center using activist investor tactics
- **Gig economy platforms**: Uber/Lyft undermining workplace democracy
- **Worker cooperatives**: Proven track record but underfunded

### 3. Education
- **School boards**: $3.2B cost of conflict in 2024, battles over curriculum/DEI
- **University administration**: 6.3% admin spending increase vs 4.7% instruction decrease
- **Student organizing**: Minimal voice in decision-making (contrast with German/Japanese systems)
- **Tuition crisis**: CSU went from $500 (1979) to $7,300 (2022)

### 4. Healthcare
- **Hospital billing**: Complex, error-prone, exploitative
- **Medicare Advantage**: 22% report care delays vs 13% traditional Medicare
- **Patient advocacy**: Growing industry but inaccessible to most
- **Insurance denials**: Excessive utilization management programs

### 5. Nonprofits (OVERLOOKED)
- **Board governance**: Legal responsibility for oversight, often fails
- **Charity watchdogs**: Charity Navigator, CharityWatch, BBB, GuideStar
- **Financial manipulation**: Less likely when monitored by rating agencies
- **Community oversight**: Minimal input from communities served

### 6. Community Governance
- **Participatory budgeting**: 11,500+ processes globally, proven to work
- **Mutual aid networks**: Egalitarian, consensus-based, transparent
- **Community land trusts**: SF Bay Area renters converting corporate buildings to CLTs

## Cross-Cutting Research Questions

### 1. Data Availability
**For each power structure, map**:
- What data is public record? (ownership, finances, violations)
- What data requires crowdsourcing? (lived experiences, organizing intel)
- What data is deliberately hidden? (shell companies, dark money)
- What are legal risks of publishing this data?

### 2. Organizing Tactics by Structure Type
**Different power structures require different tactics**:
- **Landlords**: Rent strikes, withholding, tenant associations
- **Employers**: Union drives, shareholder activism, worker cooperatives
- **HOAs**: Board takeovers, proxy voting, legal challenges
- **School boards**: Parent organizing, recall campaigns, participatory budgeting
- **Hospitals**: Medical debt cancellation, mutual aid, patient advocacy
- **Nonprofits**: Community oversight boards, participatory grantmaking
- **Government**: Electoral organizing, participatory budgeting, direct action

**Research**:
- What tactics work for which structures?
- How can cryptography enable each tactic? (anonymous organizing, ZK voting, etc.)
- What are legal risks for each?

### 3. Intersection of Power Structures
**Power structures reinforce each other**:
- Private equity owns landlords + hospitals + nursing homes
- University administrations are landlords + employers + service providers
- Nonprofits are employers + service providers + political actors
- HOAs are landlords (in a sense) + community governments

**Research**:
- Can organizing target multiple power structures simultaneously?
- Do victories in one domain enable victories in others?
- How do we map these intersections?

### 4. Scalability of Democratic Alternatives
**We know democratic alternatives exist**:
- Community land trusts (housing)
- Worker cooperatives (employment)
- Participatory budgeting (governance)
- Mutual aid networks (social safety net)
- Platform cooperatives (tech)

**But they don't scale. Research**:
- What are structural barriers to scaling? (legal, financial, cultural)
- How do bad actors capture democratic institutions?
- Can cryptography solve trust problems that limit scale?
- What policy reforms would enable scaling?

### 5. Cryptographic Infrastructure per Power Structure
**For each power structure, design**:
- Anonymous organizing primitives (what needs to be hidden?)
- Reputation systems (how to build trust without identity?)
- Coordination mechanisms (how to make collective decisions?)
- Data infrastructure (what database schemas do we need?)
- Viral amplification (how does this go viral?)

## Prioritization Framework

**Which power structures should we research FIRST?**

**Criteria**:
1. **Material impact**: Does organizing here improve people's lives measurably?
2. **Addressable market**: How many people are affected?
3. **Winnable**: Can small-scale organizing achieve victories?
4. **Viral potential**: Will victories inspire organizing elsewhere?
5. **Cryptographic fit**: Do our ZK proofs/TEE/encryption solve real problems here?
6. **Data availability**: Can we build databases without years of legal battles?
7. **Legal risk**: Will we get sued/shut down?

**My proposed priority ranking**:

### Tier 1 (Research immediately, build MVP):
1. **Landlords/housing** - High impact, large market, winnable, we have data sources
2. **Employers/workplace** - High impact, large market, crypto solves real problems (anonymous organizing)
3. **HOAs** - Overlooked, large market (62M people), winnable (board takeovers), low legal risk

### Tier 2 (Research next, build after Tier 1 validation):
4. **Healthcare/medical billing** - Massive impact, but complex, high legal risk
5. **School boards** - High impact on families, winnable, but politically fraught
6. **Nonprofits** - Overlooked, accountability gap is real, medium legal risk

### Tier 3 (Research, but slower build):
7. **Universities** - Important but niche market (students), long organizing timelines
8. **Utilities** - Monopoly problem is real, but heavily regulated, high legal barriers
9. **Food systems** - Important but diffuse, harder to organize around

### Tier 4 (Research only, very high legal risk):
10. **Prisons/immigration detention** - Massive injustice, but extreme legal/political risk

## Open Questions for User

Before I proceed with deep research, I need your guidance:

1. **Scope**: Should I research ALL power structures, or focus deeply on Tier 1 (landlords, employers, HOAs)?

2. **Timeline**: How quickly do you want comprehensive research? (2 weeks for everything? 4 weeks? 8 weeks?)

3. **Emphasis**: Which matters more right now?
   - Breadth (understand all power structures lightly)
   - Depth (deep expertise on top 3)

4. **Output format**: For each power structure, do you want:
   - Markdown docs (like WHAT-ACTUALLY-WORKS.md)?
   - Database schemas (Prisma models)?
   - User flow diagrams?
   - All of the above?

5. **Constraints**: Any power structures we should NOT research? (legal risk, political sensitivity, etc.)

6. **Next action**: Should I:
   - Start deep research on Tier 1 now?
   - Wait for your strategic direction?
   - Do something else entirely?

## Conclusion

**The problem is bigger than landlords and Congress.**

Every power structure that affects communities—from HOAs to hospitals to school boards to nonprofits—needs accountability.

**Our cryptographic infrastructure can enable organizing across ALL of them.**

But we need to research:
1. **What's broken** (for each power structure)
2. **What's been tried** (successful organizing campaigns)
3. **What's missing** (tools, data, legal reforms)
4. **What we can build** (databases, crypto primitives, viral mechanisms)

**This research outline maps the full landscape.**

**Now I need your direction on where to dive deep first.**
