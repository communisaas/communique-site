## Market Overview

### Market Size

The advocacy software market is valued at approximately **$1.0–1.5B globally** (2025–2026), growing at ~10% CAGR toward $2.4–3.8B by 2035. The grassroots advocacy subsegment — the space Commons directly competes in — is approximately **$190M** (2026), growing toward $436M by 2035 at 9.2% CAGR.

Sources vary by methodology:
- Business Research Insights: $1.02B (2026) → $2.36B (2035), 9.9% CAGR
- SNS Insider: $2.71B (2025) → $6.34B (2035), 8.87% CAGR (broader definition)
- Market Growth Reports (grassroots-specific): $191.56M (2026) → $436.03M (2035), 9.2% CAGR

### The Structural Gap

No platform in the advocacy software market verifies constituent identity. Every platform — Action Network, Quorum, EveryAction, Muster, VoterVoice, NationBuilder — relies on self-reported addresses fed through third-party geocoding (Cicero API, formerly Google Civic Info). This is not a missing feature. It is an architectural impossibility to retrofit: verification requires ZK circuits, on-chain nullifiers, government credential parsing, and a hierarchical district resolution system mapping every public boundary type (congressional through fire, water, transit, school, judicial — 24 slots per cell). Years of infrastructure work, not a sprint.

The astroturfing problem is worsening. AI-generated fake constituent messages at scale are now a documented threat ([Causes.com, 2025](https://www.causes.com/articles/55009-securing-advocacy-ai-world-understanding-authentication)). Washington state documented hundreds of phantom signatures inflating opposition to a tax bill ([WebProNews, 2025](https://www.webpronews.com/phantom-signatures-and-political-theatrics-how-fake-sign-ins-may-have-inflated-opposition-to-washington-states-millionaires-tax/)). Issue campaigns now account for 75–85% of incoming congressional mail — and offices have no tool to distinguish authentic grassroots from manufactured volume ([Congressional Management Foundation](https://www.congressfoundation.org/resources-for-congress/office-toolkit/improve-mail-operations-menu-item-new/writing-mail-home/terms/summary)).

### The District Resolution Layer

Every advocacy platform depends on **address → district → official** resolution. Two infrastructure providers dominate:

| Provider | Status | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Google Civic Information API** | **Shut down April 2025** | Was free |
| **Cicero (Melissa Data)** | Active; sole survivor for most platforms | ~$0.03/lookup, volume discounts; 1,000 free trial credits |
| **USgeocoder** | Emerging alternative post-Google shutdown | Per-lookup pricing |
| **BallotReady / Ballotpedia** | Officeholder data APIs | Custom pricing |

Google Civic Info's shutdown forced every advocacy platform to either pay Cicero or scramble for alternatives. **Commons owns the district layer** — Shadow Atlas (94,166 districts, 24 boundary types, R-tree spatial indexing, <50ms p95). Zero marginal cost. No third-party dependency.

## Platform Profiles

### Tier 1: Enterprise ($10K+/year)

#### Bonterra (EveryAction + Network for Good)

**What they are:** The dominant force in nonprofit tech. 20,000+ organizations. Formed from the merger of EveryAction, Network for Good, Social Solutions, and CyberGrants under the Bonterra brand. Progressive-leaning but not explicitly restricted like AN.

**Core capabilities:**
- Full nonprofit CRM (donor management, fundraising, grants)
- Grassroots advocacy: 99.6% message deliverability to legislators via web comment form navigation
- Multichannel outreach (email, forms, events)
- Bonterra Que: agentic AI platform (launched Oct 2025) — fundraising optimization, workflow automation, SMS/event creation, real-time campaign optimization. Currently focused on fundraising, not advocacy verification.

**Pricing:** Custom enterprise quotes. "In line with market standards for nonprofit fundraising software." Historically criticized for opaque pricing and vendor lock-in during outbound migration.

**Key limitations:**
- No identity verification
- No free/self-serve tier — enterprise sales only
- Advocacy is a secondary feature to fundraising/CRM
- Que AI is fundraising-focused, not advocacy-verification-focused
- Progressive-leaning ecosystem (not explicitly restricted like AN, but brand perception limits conservative adoption)
- Data hostage practices documented during outbound migration

**Market share:** Claims 69.5% of the nonprofit tech market (by org count, includes fundraising — not pure advocacy).

---

### The Conservative Gap

| Capability | Progressive Tools | Conservative Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Mass email + list management | Action Network ($15/mo) | None at comparable price |
| Petitions + events + forms | Action Network, EveryAction | None |
| Legislator letter campaigns | AN, EveryAction, Quorum | None (must use bipartisan enterprise platforms at $10K+) |
| Self-serve advocacy ($15–$250/mo) | AN, NationBuilder, Ujoin | **Nothing** |
| Fundraising | ActBlue | WinRed, RallyRight DonateRight |
| Canvassing | MiniVAN (EveryAction) | i360 Walk, RallyRight FieldRight |
| P2P texting | Hustle, ThruText | RumbleUp, RelayRight |
| Voter data | TargetSmart, L2 | i360, Data Trust |

Conservative orgs that need affordable advocacy tooling (email + petitions + letters to legislators) either:
1. Pay enterprise prices (Quorum, VoterVoice) if they're large enough
2. Cobble together Mailchimp + Google Forms + spreadsheets
3. Use NationBuilder (mediocre advocacy features)
4. Go without

---

## Universal Capability Comparison

### What Every Platform Offers (Table Stakes)

| Capability | How Competitors Do It | How Commons Does It | Commons Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **District matching** | Full street address → Cicero API (~$0.03/lookup) | Postal code → Shadow Atlas (94,166 districts, 24 types, <50ms) | Zero marginal cost. No third-party dependency. 24 boundary types vs. competitors' ~3 (federal, state upper, state lower). |
| **Official lookup** | Static database of ~500K officials (Cicero, Quorum, VoterVoice) | 3-phase agentic enrichment pipeline (identify → email enrich → validate) | More accurate for non-standard offices (water, transit, school board). Slower for standard offices — need caching. |
| **Email campaigns** | WYSIWYG, A/B testing, scheduling, SES/Sendgrid | WYSIWYG, A/B, scheduling, SES. Segments by engagement tier + verified district. | Segments are mathematically provable. "Established-tier constituents in CA-12" is a cryptographic filter, not a self-reported tag. |
| **Message personalization** | AI generates 100–300 variants (Quorum, CiviClick, VoterVoice SmartCheck) | Message Writer Agent: two-phase grounding-verified composition with citation validation | Every citation validated accessible. Content is grounding-verified AND sender is identity-verified. |
| **Embeddable widgets** | iframe/JS drop-in (AN, Muster, One Click, Ujoin) | iframe + postMessage. Postal Bubble → verified action in browser. | Widget produces ZK-verified actions, not form submissions. |
| **List management / CRM** | Email-keyed records, tags, self-reported geography, engagement scores | Email-keyed records, tags, identity commitment binding, engagement tiers (on-chain), district membership (24 types) | Tiers are non-fakeable. District membership is cryptographically proven, not self-reported. |
| **Analytics** | Opens, clicks, bounces, geographic heatmaps, engagement scores | Opens, clicks, bounces + coordination integrity (GDS, ALD, temporal entropy, burst velocity) + tier distribution | Coordination integrity signals: the org can prove its campaign is grassroots. No competitor has this. |
| **Advocate mapping** | District overlay on map (Muster, VoterVoice, Quorum). Typically federal + state legislative only. | Shadow Atlas: 24 boundary types per cell. H3-indexed. 94,166 districts. | Water districts, fire districts, school boards, transit authorities, judicial circuits — none of the competitors cover these. |

### What Only Some Platforms Offer

| Capability | Who Has It | Commons Status | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Patch-through calling** | Capitol Canary, CallHub, One Click | Not spec'd | P2 — Twilio extension. **Verified caller district** is a differentiator no one else has. |
| **Web form navigation** | Quorum, Capitol Canary, VoterVoice (99.6% deliverability) | Not planned | Skip — fragile (forms change constantly). Verification packet sent directly is more impactful. |
| **Legislative tracking / bill alerts** | Quorum, FiscalNote, FastDemocracy, PolicyEngage | Spec'd (agentic-civic-infrastructure, Phase 3) | P3 — Agent monitors bills affecting verified districts. ~$6.50/org/month. |
| **Legislator scorecards** | Quorum, FastDemocracy, Legislative Scorecard | Not spec'd | P2 — Natural extension of campaign delivery + response tracking. |
| **Video messages to officials** | CiviClick, One Click | Not planned | Skip — niche, low ROI. |
| **Social media advocacy** | Quorum, Capitol Canary, CiviClick, Ujoin | Not planned | Skip — low ROI relative to engineering cost. |
| **Fax to officials** | VoterVoice, legacy platforms | Not planned | Skip — legacy. |
| **SMS campaigns** | Most platforms | Spec'd (Phase 3, Twilio) | P2/P3 |
| **Gamification** | CiviClick | Not planned | Skip — engagement tiers are structural, not gamified. |
| **Debate / quality signals** | Nobody | **Built** (LMSR + AI panel, 193 tests) | Structural advantage — no competitor has any mechanism for quality. |
| **Coordination integrity** | Nobody | **Built** (GDS, ALD, temporal entropy, burst velocity) | Structural advantage — anti-astroturf proof that ships with every campaign. |
| **Verified identity** | Nobody | **Built** (5 circuits, 4 depths, mDL parsing, browser ZK) | Structural advantage — years of infrastructure, zero marginal cost. |
| **Portable reputation** | Nobody | **Built** (engagement tiers 0–4, on-chain, cross-org) | Structural advantage — protocol-level, not app-level. |

---

## AI Landscape

Every major platform is shipping AI in 2025–2026. None of them verify the identity behind the AI action.

| Platform | AI Product | Launch | Capabilities | Identity Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bonterra** | Que | Oct 2025 | Agentic AI for fundraising: workflow automation, SMS/event creation, campaign optimization, report building. Human-led (approve/reject). | **None** |
| **Quorum** | Quincy 2.0 | Jan 2025 | Legislative analysis: bill summarization, amendment tracking, natural language search, stakeholder insights. Trained on legislative text. | **None** |
| **VoterVoice** | SmartCheck (ChatGPT) | 2024 | Subject line optimization, CTA tuning, message personalization. | **None** |
| **CiviClick** | CiviClick Amplified | 2024 | AI-personalized outreach across channels, real-time analytics optimization. | **None** |
| **Action Network** | None | — | No AI features. | **None** |
| **Commons** | Message Writer, Subject Line, Decision-Maker Discovery agents + agentic delegation (spec'd) | Production (agents), spec'd (delegation) | Grounding-verified message composition, multi-turn subject line refinement, 3-phase decision-maker resolution. **Agentic delegation**: agents act on behalf of verified constituents, tier-gated authority, ZK proof on every action, privacy-preserving memory. | **ZK proof on every agent action** |

The structural difference: Bonterra Que helps an org raise money faster. Quorum Quincy helps a lobbyist analyze bills faster. Commons agents help a verified constituent participate in democracy with the same ZK proof whether they act manually or delegate to an agent. The identity verification is on the action, not the platform.

## What Congressional Offices Receive

Congressional staffers process 75–85% of incoming mail as form-generated advocacy campaigns. Personalized messages are 7x more effective than form letters. 90% of staff say individualized messages have "a lot of positive influence" on undecided Members; form messages score significantly lower ([Congressional Management Foundation](https://www.congressfoundation.org/blog/917-its-not-how-you-send-it-its-whats-inside)).

| Signal | Current Platforms | Commons |
|---|---|---|
| Count | "847 people emailed" | "847 verified constituents in CA-12" |
| Identity | Email address (self-reported) | ZK proof of government credential |
| District | Self-reported ZIP → Cicero lookup (often wrong; 15–20% of ZIP codes span multiple CDs) | Merkle proof against hierarchical district tree (24 boundary types) |
| Credibility | None | Engagement tier distribution (89 Pillars, 112 Established) |
| Quality | None (Quorum: 300 AI message variants, but no quality signal) | Debate market signal (62% AMEND, market depth $247) |
| Authenticity | None | GDS 0.91, ALD 0.87, temporal entropy 0.93 |
| Privacy | Org has full PII, can be compelled to disclose | ZK — platform cannot link proof to person |

---

## Action Network — Deep Comparison

**What they are:** SaaS advocacy toolkit for progressive orgs. 12,000+ orgs, 55M+ letters sent, ~14 years in market. OSDI API v1.1.1 (capped at 4 req/s on paid plans, unavailable on free).

**What Commons is:** Not Action Network with verification bolted on. A different thing. Every feature — email, letters, list management, analytics — works differently when built on verified identity, because the atom of the system is a cryptographic proof, not an email address.

### Unified Feature Comparison

| Feature | Action Network | Commons |
|---|---|---|
| **Email** | WYSIWYG, A/B, SES. No identity context. Every recipient is an email address. | WYSIWYG, A/B, SES. Segments by engagement tier + verified district. Every send references verification state. An email to "Established-tier constituents in CA-12" is a fundamentally different object than an email to "people who typed 94607 into a form." |
| **Letter campaigns** | Congress + state legislatures. District from self-reported ZIP. No way to verify the sender lives there. | Any of 24 district types — congressional through fire, water, transit, school, judicial. District from Postal Bubble + mDL. Letter carries a ZK proof. The letter is a verified civic instrument, not a form submission. |
| **List management** | Tags, CSV import/export, self-reported geography. An org's list is a collection of unverified claims. | Tags, CSV import/export, engagement tiers (non-fakeable, on-chain), district membership across 24 boundary types. An org's list is a set of cryptographically attested relationships. |
| **Analytics** | CSV export. Opens, clicks. No way to distinguish real constituents from bots or out-of-district signers. | Full dashboard. Opens, clicks, verified actions, tier distribution, GDS, ALD, temporal entropy. Analytics answer "who engaged" with mathematical certainty, not probabilistic guessing. |
| **Identity** | Email + self-reported address. Platform stores full PII. | ZK proof of government credential. Platform stores commitment, not PII. Identity is a proof, not a record. |
| **Credibility signal** | Count of emails sent. Staffers have no basis for trust. | Verification packet: verified count, tier distribution, coordination integrity scores (GDS, ALD, entropy), debate market signal. Staffers can mathematically verify every claim. |
| **Pricing** | $15-$125/mo, no free tier | $0-$200/mo, free tier with full API |
| **Political scope** | Progressive only (501(c)(4) ToS). Half the market excluded by policy. | All — protocol verifies proof, not politics. Verification is orthogonal to ideology. |
| **API** | Paid plans only, 4 req/s cap | Free, all tiers, no cap |
| **Reputation** | None. Every supporter is equally weightless. | Engagement tiers: New (0), Active (1), Established (2), Veteran (3), Pillar (4). Non-purchasable, on-chain, portable across orgs. |
| **Privacy** | Plaintext PII. Fully subpoena-able. | ZK proofs. Platform cannot link proof to person. Cannot be compelled to disclose what it doesn't possess. Privacy is structural, not policy. |
| **Debate / quality** | None. Volume is the only metric. | LMSR market + AI panel. sqrt(stake) * 2^tier. Quality of reasoning, not just count. |
| **Agentic** | None. | Verified delegation. Tier-gated. Privacy-preserving memory. ZK proof on every agent action. |
| **Portability** | Per-org silos. Reputation resets with every new org. | Protocol-level identity. Verification and reputation travel across every org on the protocol. |
| **Custom domain** | Paid add-on | Included (Organization tier+) |
| **SQL mirror** | +$200/month add-on | Included (Organization tier+) |

## Moats

### Theirs

| Platform | Moat | Durability |
|---|---|---|
| **Bonterra/EveryAction** | 20K+ org installed base, full-stack nonprofit CRM, vendor lock-in during migration, progressive ecosystem entrenchment | **High** — CRM switching costs are massive. But advocacy is a secondary feature; orgs may use Commons for advocacy alongside EveryAction for fundraising. |
| **Quorum** | Legislative data feeds (all 50 states + local), Quincy AI trained on legislative text, 50%+ Fortune 100 clients, 9-module bundling | **High** — data licensing + enterprise relationships. But price ($10K+) excludes most of the market. |
| **VoterVoice** | FiscalNote parent (publicly traded, regulatory data), industry benchmarking data, 2,000+ org network | **Medium** — benchmark data is valuable but not defensible long-term. |
| **Action Network** | 12K+ org base, coalition network effects, progressive brand, embedded page lock-in (iframes across org websites) | **Medium** — OSDI provides some portability; progressive-only restriction halves addressable market; brand doesn't help with deliverability problems. |
| **i360** | 250M voter records, Koch network distribution, predictive models | **Medium-High** — data is valuable but siloed to conservative campaigns, not advocacy. |

### Ours

| Moat | Description | Replicability |
|---|---|---|
| **Cryptographic verification** | 5 circuits, 4 depths, 13 contracts, 7 audit rounds. Years of infrastructure. | **Very low** — requires deep expertise in ZK, mDL parsing, government credential standards, circuit design. No competitor has started. |
| **Shadow Atlas (district layer)** | 94,166 districts, 24 boundary types, R-tree spatial index. Owned data, zero marginal cost. | **Low** — Cicero charges per lookup; Google shut down. Building a competing district layer at this scope is a multi-year effort. |
| **Zero marginal cost verification** | ZK proofs generate in user's browser (noir_js + bb.js). Server cost: $0. | **Very low** — browser-side ZK proof generation is cutting-edge. Requires Noir circuit design, WASM compilation, mDL credential parsing. |
| **Protocol composability** | Identity portable, reputation portable, network effects at protocol layer not app layer. | **Low** — requires on-chain infrastructure. App-layer competitors can't retrofit protocol-layer identity. |
| **Political neutrality** | Verification is orthogonal to ideology. 2x addressable market vs. progressive-only competitors. | **Medium** — any new platform could be neutral, but incumbents' brand/ecosystem associations are hard to shed. |
| **Anti-astroturf signals** | GDS, ALD, temporal entropy, burst velocity computed automatically from on-chain action data. Ships with every campaign. | **Low** — requires verified identity to be meaningful. Without ZK proof, these signals can be gamed. |

## Go-to-Market

### Beachhead segments (Year 1–2)

1. **Science/health advocacy** — credibility over volume. ALI, disease foundations, research coalitions. These orgs need staffers to *believe* the signers are real. Verification is the product.
2. **Nonpartisan/conservative groups** — structurally excluded from AN (progressive-only ToS) and priced out of enterprise platforms (Quorum, VoterVoice at $10K+). Underserved market with no good tooling at the $10–$200/mo price point.
3. **Small orgs** — free tier vs AN's $15/month minimum. Full API access. No paywall on analytics.
4. **Local government advocacy** — school boards, water districts, transit authorities, fire districts, judicial circuits. 21 of 24 Shadow Atlas boundary types have **zero** coverage from any competitor. Shadow Atlas resolves districts that Quorum and VoterVoice literally don't have in their databases.

### Expansion (Year 2–4)

5. **Progressive orgs wanting proof** — run Commons alongside AN. Use AN for volume, Commons for verified actions. Migration path when they see the difference in staffer response rates. AN API sync tool (spec'd in `docs/specs/AN-MIGRATION-SPEC.md`) reduces migration from 6 months to weeks.
6. **Corporate advocacy / trade associations** — currently paying $10K–$30K+/year to Quorum/VoterVoice. Commons Organization tier at $75/mo ($900/yr) is 10–30x cheaper. Verification packet is more credible than volume metrics.

### Differentiated capabilities by segment

| Segment | What they need | What competitors offer | What Commons offers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Science/health | Credible constituent proof | Unverified email counts | ZK-verified counts + tier distribution + coordination integrity |
| Conservative/nonpartisan | Affordable advocacy tooling | Nothing at <$7,500/yr | Full platform at $0–$200/mo |
| Small orgs | Free/cheap, easy setup | AN $15/mo (no API), NationBuilder $29/mo | Free tier with full API |
| Local government | Sub-state district targeting | Federal + state legislative only | 24 boundary types including school, water, fire, transit, judicial |
| Progressive orgs | Better response rates from offices | Volume-based, unverified | Verified + unverified side-by-side. Migration tool. |
| Corporate/trade | Legislative tracking + advocacy | Quorum/VoterVoice at $10K+/yr | $75/mo Organization tier + agentic bill monitoring (Phase 3) |
