## 2. Next Wave: 2026-2027 Launches

### Tier 1: Very High Probability (2026)

| State | Population | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Texas** | 30M | HB 3426 signed 2025. DPS mandated to issue mDL. ISO 18013-5 required in statute. | Largest potential mDL rollout in US history. DPS RFP expected 2026. |
| **North Carolina** | 10.7M | HB 199 signed July 2024. DMV study complete (Jan 2025). Vendor procurement active. | 12-month timeline if leveraging existing vendor. Est. $750K-$1.4M. |
| **New Jersey** | 9.3M | Legislation signed July 2025. $1.5M budget allocated. | Implementation required by 2031 (deadline is far, but funding is now). |

### Tier 2: Probable (2026-2027)

| State | Population | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Idaho** | 1.9M | HB 78 passed House 37-33. Pending Senate. | Narrow partisan vote — may face Senate resistance. |
| **Alabama** | 5.1M | HB 110 pre-filed for 2026 session. $15 fee model. | Session started Jan 2026. Passage not guaranteed. |
| **Oklahoma** | 4.0M | Full DL system overhaul with Thales + IDEMIA. | Had mDL, paused, retooling. Apple Wallet committed. |
| **Connecticut** | 3.6M | Committed to Apple Wallet mDL. No timeline. | Announced but no legislation or procurement visible. |
| **Mississippi** | 3.0M | Committed to Apple Wallet mDL. IDEMIA contract. | Announced but no firm date. |

### Tier 3: Later (2027+)

| State | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Pennsylvania** | HB 1247 stalled in committee since March 2024. Large population (13M). |
| **Indiana** | Plans announced 2024, no legislation signed. |
| **D.C.** | Plans announced 2024, no live program. |
| **Florida** | Program killed July 2024 (DeSantis). Could re-emerge under new administration. |

### Explicitly Absent

**Texas** was absent but is now in Tier 1 (HB 3426 signed). **Florida** rejected mDL (program killed July 2024).

## 3. Vendor Landscape

### Market Share

| Vendor | States | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **IDEMIA** | AZ, AR, DE, IA, KY, MS, NY, WV + Samsung Wallet integrations | Market leader. 10-year GSA agreement for Login.gov. Trinsic partnership (Feb 2026) for remote verification. |
| **Thales** | AK, CO, GA, HI, MD (backend), OK (retool) | Physical card production for 17 NA agencies. Biometric enrollment kiosks in GA. |
| **SpruceID** | CA | Open-source reader (OpenCred on GitHub). NIST NCCoE partner. |
| **GET Group NA** | UT | Only US mDL with full UL ISO 18013-5 certification (all interaction modes). |
| **CBN** | VA | Canadian Bank Note Company. VA-only in US market. |
| **Envoc** | LA | Proprietary pre-standard format. ~2M mDLs issued (most in US). NOT ISO 18013-5 compliant. |

### Wallet Distribution

| Wallet | States | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Apple Wallet | 14 states + PR (live), 5 more committed | Dominant in states with wallet integration |
| Google Wallet | 10 states (live), 3 announced | Trailing Apple by ~4 states |
| Samsung Wallet | ~7 states | Bundled with IDEMIA platform states |
| State-only apps | LA, NY, UT, VA, AK, KY, DE | No OS wallet integration (yet) |

### Non-ISO 18013-5 Implementations

**Louisiana (LA Wallet / Envoc)** is the only confirmed non-compliant state:
- Launched 2018, before ISO 18013-5 was finalized (2021)
- Proprietary QR-code-based format
- TSA accepts it, but it's not verifiable via standard COSE/CBOR pipeline
- Open feature request for ISO 18013-5 conformance (not retrofitted as of 2026)
- ~2M mDLs issued — largest single-state program by far

All other live programs use ISO 18013-5 compliant implementations.

### Fragmentation Note

As of Oct 2025: ~21 states live, **17 different wallet implementations**. 9 states issue only into standalone apps; 10 offer state app + OS wallet. The AAMVA VICAL solves the trust layer but not the transport layer (NFC vs QR vs BLE vs OpenID4VP varies by state).

## 4. IACA Certificate Distribution

### Distribution Methods

| Method | States | Ease of Acquisition |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **AAMVA VICAL** | All DTS members | Click-through T&C, free, CBOR-encoded. Universal source. |
| **Direct .gov download** | CA, GA, AZ, NM, HI, OH, PR | Public URL, no agreement needed. Best for us. |
| **Vendor SDK bundle** | IDEMIA states (via SDK) | Requires vendor relationship. Not public. |
| **Request-only** | Some states | Email/form required. Slow. |

### AAMVA VICAL Details

- URL: `https://vical.dts.aamva.org/currentVical`
- Format: CBOR-encoded signed list per ISO 18013-5 Annex B
- Access: Free, T&C click-through (not org-gated)
- Coverage: Growing — not all live states are in VICAL yet
- Refresh: We already parse this via `scripts/parse-vical.ts`
- **This is our primary acquisition channel.** Run the parse script quarterly (or when VICAL version increments).

### States with Direct Public IACA Downloads

| State | URL |
|-------|-----|
| California | `https://trust.dmv.ca.gov/certificates/ca-dmv-iaca-root-ca-crt.cer` |
| Georgia | `https://dds.georgia.gov/document/document/ga-mdl-rootzip/download` |
| Arizona | `https://azmvdnow.gov/certificates` (JS-rendered page) |
| New Mexico | `https://www.mvd.newmexico.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-Mexico-IACA-Certificate.zip` |
| Hawaii | `https://hidot.hawaii.gov/highways/files/2024/08/2024_HI_IACA_Root.zip` |
| Ohio | `https://bmvonline.dps.ohio.gov` (ohio_mdl_iaca_root_2024.zip) |
| Puerto Rico | `https://docs.pr.gov/files/ID_movil-mDL/Certificado_IACA/PRDTOPProdCA.pem` |

## 5. Coverage Prioritization: Next States to Add

### Scoring Criteria

- **Population:** Voter reach (larger = more impact)
- **IACA ease:** Already in VICAL or public .gov download = easy
- **mDL adoption:** Active program with growing user base
- **Political diversity:** Need red, blue, purple for credibility
- **ISO compliance:** Must be 18013-5 (skip Louisiana)

### Priority Ranking

| Priority | State | Pop. | Political Lean | IACA Source | mDL Status | Rationale |
|----------|-------|------|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **P0** | **New York** | 20.2M | Blue | AAMVA VICAL / IDEMIA | Live, 246K users, growing fast | Largest uncovered state. Blue state balance. |
| **P0** | **Iowa** | 3.2M | Red/Purple | AAMVA VICAL / IDEMIA | Live, multi-wallet | Purple state. All major wallets. |
| **P0** | **Arkansas** | 3.0M | Red | AAMVA VICAL / IDEMIA | Live since Mar 2025 | Deep red state. Balance for credibility. |
| **P1** | **West Virginia** | 1.8M | Red | AAMVA VICAL / IDEMIA | Live, multi-wallet | Red state. Small but easy (IDEMIA = VICAL). |
| **P1** | **Kentucky** | 4.5M | Red | AAMVA VICAL / IDEMIA | Live since Jan 2026 | Red state. IDEMIA platform. |
| **P2** | **Delaware** | 1.0M | Blue | IDEMIA SDK (may need request) | Live since 2021 | Oldest US mDL. Small pop. IACA acquisition uncertain. |
| **P2** | **Texas** | 30.0M | Red | TBD (not yet launched) | HB 3426 signed, DPS procurement | Largest prize. Not live yet — monitor for RFP/launch. |
| **P2** | **North Carolina** | 10.7M | Purple | TBD (not yet launched) | Vendor procurement active | Large purple state. Watch for 2026 launch. |

### Recommended Action Plan

**Immediate (this quarter):**
1. Re-run `scripts/parse-vical.ts` against latest VICAL — NY, IA, AR, WV, KY may already be in the VICAL
2. If found in VICAL, add to trust store (zero acquisition effort)
3. If not in VICAL, check IDEMIA's Trinsic partnership for cert access

**Near-term (Q2 2026):**
4. Monitor Texas DPS for RFP announcement and mDL launch timeline
5. Monitor North Carolina vendor selection
6. Assess Delaware IACA availability (may require IDEMIA contact)

**Ongoing:**
7. Re-parse VICAL monthly during expansion phase
8. Track ISO 18013-5 2nd edition (DIS ballot closes March 26, 2026; final expected July 2026)
9. Watch ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 (online mDL) adoption — affects our OpenID4VP flow
