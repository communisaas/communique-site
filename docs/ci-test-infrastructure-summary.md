# CI Test Infrastructure Summary

## What We Built

**CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with PostgreSQL, graduated test execution (unit → integration → E2E), coverage reporting.

**Stability Features**: Environment validation, CI-aware timeouts, OAuth test setup, enhanced error reporting.

**Drift Detection**: Automated monitoring for database schema changes, API coverage, service integration consistency.

**Health Monitoring**: Performance tracking, failure pattern analysis, memory leak detection, maintenance task generation.

## Pipeline Configuration

**PostgreSQL**: Service container with health checks in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Three-Phase Testing**:

1. Unit Tests (5min): Core logic
2. Integration Tests (8min): Full flows
3. E2E Tests (10min): Browser scenarios

**Quality Gates**: Type checking, ESLint, coverage thresholds, build verification.

## Monitoring Systems

**Mock Drift Detection** (`tests/config/mock-drift-detection.ts`):

- Detects new Prisma models without mocks
- Scans for untested API routes
- Validates OAuth provider consistency

**Test Health** (`tests/config/test-monitoring.ts`):

- Tracks execution times and memory usage
- Categorizes failures: OAuth (non-blocking), Database/API (blocking), Environment (infrastructure)
- Generates maintenance recommendations

## Key Features

**Environment Consistency**: Tracks env changes, warns about test pollution, resets state after runs.

**CI Compatibility**: Auto-configures DATABASE_URL based on CI environment.

**OAuth Reliability**: Safe local defaults, CI overrides, provider-specific failure isolation.

## Generated Artifacts

```

## Maintenance

**Weekly**: `npm run test:health`, `npm run test:drift`

**Test Failure Response**:

1. Assess (0-5min)
2. Categorize (OAuth/Database/Environment)
3. Analyze impact (Blocking/Non-blocking)
4. Resolve based on severity

## Metrics

**Performance**: Unit <5min, Integration <8min, E2E <10min, Total <25min

**Quality**: Coverage >70%, Flakiness <2%, False positives <5%

**Improvements**: From manual setup to automated validation, reactive to proactive failure handling.

npm run test:production  # Production tests
npm run test:health      # Health reports
npm run test:drift       # Mock drift check
```
