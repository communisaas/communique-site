> Verified actions are the unit of value. Email is commodity infrastructure.

## The Insight

Every advocacy platform sends email. It costs $0.10/1K via SES. Email is table stakes — orgs will never pay a premium for it.

What no other platform can produce is a **verified action**: a cryptographically proven constituent contacting their verified representative, with district membership confirmed by a ZK proof that runs entirely in the user's browser. Server cost for verification: **$0**. Years of infrastructure required for a competitor to replicate it: **many**.

Commons charges for verified actions. The verification itself is free to operate (browser-side ZK), which means every dollar of verified-action revenue is structurally high-margin. This is the business.

## Structural Cost Advantages

| Cost Center | Why It's Cheap |
|---|---|
| **Identity verification** | ZK proofs generate in the user's browser (noir_js + bb.js). Server cost: $0. No other platform has this capability at any price — Commons has it at zero marginal cost. |
| **Email delivery** | Amazon SES: $0.10/1K. Commodity. No proprietary mail infrastructure to maintain. |
| **On-chain actions** | Scroll L2: ~$0.01/action. Batched nullifier registration. |

The expensive parts of the system (ZK circuits, smart contracts, Shadow Atlas, AI evaluator) are already built. Marginal cost per verified action is dominated by on-chain gas ($0.01), not verification ($0.00).

| Cost Center | COGS | Price | Margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Verified action (Scroll) | $0.01/action | $3.00/1K | 70% |

## Infrastructure at Scale (1,000 orgs)

| Component | Service | Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| Application | Cloudflare Pages | $200 |
| Database | Neon Postgres (+ pgvector) | $300 |
| Email delivery | Amazon SES | $3,000 |
| Queue | Upstash Redis | $100 |
| Storage | Cloudflare R2 | $50 |
| Search | Meilisearch | $100 |
| Scroll L2 gas | 300K actions | $3,000 |
| Shadow Atlas | Self-hosted | $200 |
| **Agentic layer** | Gemini + Exa + Firecrawl + LegiScan + Groq | **$4,500** |
| **Total COGS** | | **~$11,500** |

## Projection (1,000 orgs)

| | Monthly |
|---|---|
| Revenue | $60,500 |
| COGS | $11,500 |
| **Gross profit** | **$49,000** |
| **Gross margin** | **81%** |

The growth line is verified actions, not email volume. As orgs discover that verified constituent contacts produce 3-10x the legislative response rate of unverified email blasts, they move up tiers to unlock more verified actions — not more emails. Email overage revenue is noise. Verified action overage at $1.50-$3.00/1K against $0.01 COGS is the margin engine.

Agentic layer adds ~$4,500/month (with model tiering + shared screening optimizations). Legislative monitoring is the largest agentic cost center — bill screening across all district types for every org. Included at Organization tier and above, not Free/Starter. LLM inference costs falling ~50% annually. Full cost breakdown: `specs/agentic-civic-infrastructure.md`.
