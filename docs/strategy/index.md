# Strategic Documentation

**Read these in order to understand Communiqué's strategic direction.**

## Start Here: Core Strategy

### 1. [launch.md](launch.md) - Phase 1 Launch Plan (3 months)

Privacy-preserving constituent intelligence. Zero-knowledge proofs, aggregate tracking, viral mechanisms.

**Core insight**: Individual congressional messages are theater. 5,000 coordinated messages from verified constituents create leverage.

### 2. [coordination.md](coordination.md) - Coordination Mechanics

Why individual action fails, coordination works. Platform mechanics for collective power.

**Evidence**: Congressional offices take meetings when 5,000+ constituents coordinate. One-off messages are ignored.

### 3. [organizing.md](organizing.md) - Organizing Reality

What organizing victories look like, why organizing fails, class struggle infrastructure vs civic engagement theater.

**What wins**: Rent strikes (247 days → rent caps), union drives (74% win rate), ballot initiatives ($15/hour in Missouri)

**Why it fails**: Free rider problem, fear of retaliation, surveillance/infiltration

**What we build**: Anonymous organizing tools, retaliation defense, counter-surveillance

## Growth & Product Strategy

### 4. [viral.md](viral.md) - Viral Growth Strategy

Shareable impact cards, gamification, leaderboards, network visualization. Making civic action social currency.

**Implementation status**: Partial (social proof + shareable cards exist, full gamification not built)

**Serves**: Mainstream users (NPR listeners, low-risk civic action)

### 5. [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) - Product Roadmap

Product milestones, timelines, feature releases.

### 6. [delivery-verification.md](delivery-verification.md) - Delivery Verification Strategy

TEE-based email verification roadmap, OAuth persistence, congressional signatures, browser-native proving.

**What it covers**: 4-phase approach to verify congressional message delivery without violating cypherpunk privacy principles.

**Phases**: OAuth persistence (Phase 1) → TEE verification (Phase 2) → Congressional signatures (Phase 3) → Browser-native (Phase 4)

**Status**: Phase 1 implemented (OAuth), Phase 2-4 planned

## Strategic Clarity

**Communiqué serves two complementary audiences**:

**Mainstream users** (viral.md):
- Shareable impact cards, gamification, social proof
- Low-risk, high-volume participation
- Congressional message campaigns

**Organizers** (organizing.md):
- Anonymous union card signing, threshold signatures
- Retaliation defense, mutual aid, legal support
- High-risk, high-impact collective action
- Rent strikes, union drives, ballot initiatives

Both strategies are necessary. Viral growth builds user base (breadth). Organizing tools serve people taking real risk (depth).
