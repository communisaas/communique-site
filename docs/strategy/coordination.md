# Commons: Coordination Platform

> **STATUS: HISTORICAL** — January 2025 messaging and coordination strategy document. Implementation status table below is outdated. See [`product-roadmap.md`](product-roadmap.md) for current priorities and [`index.md`](index.md) for how Person Layer + Org Layer now structure the product.

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-08
**Status**: Pre-launch, active development
**Single Source of Truth**: This document

## The Core Problem

**Individual action fails. Coordination works.**

- One complaint → Gets filed
- 5,000 coordinated messages → Get meetings

Decision-makers ignore scattered noise. They respond to coordinated pressure.

---

## What We Built

### A Coordination Platform

**NOT**:
- ❌ Message delivery service
- ❌ Verification platform
- ❌ Privacy tool
- ❌ Blockchain app

**YES**:
- ✅ **Template creation** - Anyone can start a campaign
- ✅ **Viral sharing** - Share everywhere (Discord, Twitter, QR codes)
- ✅ **Social proof** - Public counters show coordination
- ✅ **Smart routing** - Right decision-maker gets the message
- ✅ **Privacy preservation** - Zero data retention

---

## How It Works

### 1. Template Creator
Someone identifies an issue and writes a template:
- Clear subject line
- Persuasive message body
- Specific ask
- Target decision-makers

### 2. Viral Spread
Template gets shared everywhere:
- Social media (Twitter, Discord, Reddit)
- Group chats (Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp)
- Physical events (QR codes at protests, meetings)
- Email lists

### 3. Coordination Visible
Public counters show coordinated action:
- "5,247 people sent this"
- "Active in 47 states"
- "+127 in the last hour"

### 4. Decision-Makers See It
They can't ignore coordinated pressure:
- 5,000 identical messages = organized constituency
- Geographic spread = proves it's real (not bots)
- Public counters = "This issue has momentum"

---

## The Messaging (Coordination-First)

### Homepage Hero:

```
Your voice. Their decision.

Coordinate pressure that can't be ignored.

One complaint gets filed. 5,000 coordinated messages get meetings.
```

**Why it works**:
- Problem/solution clear (1 vs 5,000)
- Outcome-focused ("get meetings")
- No fake numbers (we're pre-launch)
- Coordination = core value prop
- No loaded words ("campaigns", "issues") - just direct action

---

### Address Collection (When Needed):

```
Find who represents you

Your address routes your message to the right officials.
Used once. Deleted immediately.

[Why your address? →]
Officials only respond to constituents in their jurisdiction.
Your address proves you're affected by their decisions.
```

**Why it works**:
- Explains WHY (routing, not data collection)
- Clear benefit ("find who represents you")
- Privacy promise (used once, deleted)
- Progressive disclosure (deeper why)

---

### Template Card (With Real Data):

**Pre-launch** (no fake numbers):
```
[Template Title]
Created by [Author]
Last updated [Date]

[Send Now] [Share]
```

**Post-launch** (with real counters):
```
[Template Title]
5,247 sent this
Active in 47 states
+127 in the last hour

[Send Now] [Share]
```

**Language note**: "5,247 sent this" not "5,247 people". Shorter. More direct. Coordination count speaks for itself.

---

## The Technical Stack (Simplified)

### What Users See:
1. Browse templates (homepage)
2. Click "Send Now" (button)
3. Enter address if needed (modal)
4. Message sent (mailto: or API)
5. Share campaign (social proof)

### What Happens Behind:
1. **Routing** - Address → Census API → Congressional district → Representatives
2. **Privacy** - Address encrypted → Used once → Deleted
3. **Counters** - Increment send count → Update geographic spread
4. **Attribution** - Template creator gets credit

### What We DON'T Do:
- ❌ Store addresses (deleted after routing)
- ❌ Track individual users (only aggregate counts)
- ❌ Sell data (never)
- ❌ Centralize control (open template creation)

---

## The Routing Logic

### Decision Tree:

```
User clicks "Send Now"
    ↓
What type of decision-maker?
    │
    ├─ Government (Congress, state, local)
    │   → Require address (constituent verification)
    │   → "Find who represents you"
    │
    ├─ School Board / HOA / Local
    │   → Require zip code (lighter touch)
    │   → "Find your school board"
    │
    └─ Company / Public Figure
        → Email verification (OAuth)
        → "Verify your message"
```

---

## The Privacy Model

### What We Collect:

**For Routing** (temporary):
- Address (if government target)
- Encrypted → Routed → Deleted

**For Coordination** (aggregate):
- Send count per template
- Geographic distribution (state-level)
- Momentum (hourly send rate)

**For Attribution**:
- Template creator (public)
- Creation date (public)

### What We DON'T Collect:
- ❌ Who sent which template
- ❌ Individual addresses (deleted after routing)
- ❌ Email credentials (OAuth, never stored)
- ❌ User behavior tracking

---

## The Viral Mechanics

### Social Proof:
- "5,247 people sent this" (FOMO)
- "Active in 47 states" (not astroturf)
- "+127 in the last hour" (momentum)

### Easy Sharing:
- Pre-written messages (4 contexts: Twitter, Slack, Email, SMS)
- QR codes (physical → digital)
- Native share API (mobile)
- Clipboard fallback (desktop)

### Attribution:
- Template creator gets credit
- Public profile shows impact
- Reputation builds over time

## Implementation Status (as of Jan 2025 — outdated)

> **Note**: This status table reflects January 2025. Since then, OAuth authentication (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Coinbase), the full org layer (campaigns, supporters, email delivery), mDL identity verification, Action Network import, and the embeddable campaign widget have all shipped. See `product-roadmap.md` for current status.

### ✅ Complete:
1. Template browsing & preview
2. Address collection & routing (congressional)
3. Privacy-first UX (progressive disclosure)
4. Universal voice (Congress, companies, school boards)
5. Email provider OAuth component (stub)

### 🚧 In Progress (Jan 2025):
1. Real send counters (no fake numbers)
2. Geographic distribution tracking
3. Momentum tracking (+127/hour)
4. Template creator profiles

### 📋 Planned (Jan 2025):
1. Smart routing (government vs company vs school)
2. OAuth email verification (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Multi-country support (UK, Canada, EU)
4. A/B testing infrastructure

---

## The Copy Framework

### Universal Structure:

**Problem** (Individual action fails):
> One complaint gets filed.

**Solution** (Coordination works):
> 5,000 coordinated messages get meetings.

**How** (The platform):
> Coordinate campaigns that decision-makers can't ignore.

**Outcome** (Measurable):
> Get meetings. Change decisions.

## What NOT to Say (Cruft to Avoid)

### ❌ Verification Language:
- "Send verified messages" (solves wrong problem)
- "Proof of delivery" (nice to have, not core)
- "Zero-knowledge proofs" (tech flex, users don't care)

### ❌ Privacy-Defensive:
- "but never stored" (defensive tone)
- "We protect your privacy" (everyone says this)
- Over-explaining what we DON'T do

### ❌ Individual Action Framing:
- "Your voice matters" (weak)
- "Make a difference" (vague)
- "Be heard" (passive)

### ❌ Loaded Category Words:
- "campaigns" (politically loaded, implies fundraising/elections)
- "issues" (heavy, problem-focused, political baggage)
- "causes" (charity connotation, weak)
- Just use location names as filters. Templates speak for themselves.

### ❌ Fake Numbers:
- "Join 12,847 people" (WE HAVEN'T LAUNCHED YET)
- "2,134 campaigns" (FAKE)
- Any made-up social proof

---

## What TO Say (Core Truth)

### ✅ Coordination Language:
- "5,247 sent this" (when true - shorter, more direct)
- "Active in 47 states" (when true)
- "+127 in the last hour" (when true)
- "Coordinate pressure that can't be ignored" (no "campaigns")

### ✅ Location as Filter (Not Category):
- "Texas" (just the location name)
- "47 coordinating" (coordination count is the signal)
- Templates speak for themselves (no "issues in" or "campaigns in")

### ✅ Routing Logic:
- "Your address routes your message"
- "Find who represents you"
- Clear WHY (constituent verification)

### ✅ Privacy Promise (Brief):
- "Used once. Deleted immediately."
- Progressive disclosure for details

### ✅ Outcome-Focused:
- "Get meetings" (not "be heard")
- "Can't ignore" (not "might listen")
- "Coordinated pressure works" (truth)

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Real Counters (This Week)
1. Remove all fake numbers
2. Implement real send tracking
3. Show counters only when > 0
4. "Be the first to send this" (when = 0)

### Phase 2: Geographic Spread (Next Week)
1. Track state-level distribution
2. Show "Active in X states"
3. Heatmap visualization
4. Prevent astroturf (rate limiting)

### Phase 3: Momentum Tracking (Week 3)
1. Hourly send rate calculation
2. "+127 in the last hour" display
3. FOMO-driven urgency
4. Viral coefficient measurement

### Phase 4: Launch (Week 4)
1. Real campaigns from real users
2. A/B test coordination messaging
3. Measure viral spread (k > 1.0)
4. Decision-maker responses

## The Bottom Line

**What we are**:
> Coordination platform for civic pressure campaigns.

**What we're not**:
> Message delivery service with verification features.

**Core insight**:
> Scattered complaints get filed. Coordinated campaigns get meetings.

**Next**:
> Remove fake numbers. Ship real counters. Launch.
