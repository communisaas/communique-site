# Strategic Documentation

**Read these in order to understand Communiqué's strategic direction:**

---

## 1. Phase 1 Launch (3 months)

**[PHASE-1-REALITY-GROUNDED.md](PHASE-1-REALITY-GROUNDED.md)**

Privacy-preserving constituent intelligence. Zero-knowledge proofs, aggregate tracking, viral mechanisms.

**Core insight**: Individual congressional messages are theater. 5,000 coordinated messages from verified constituents create leverage.

---

## 2. Coordination Mechanics

**[COORDINATION-PLATFORM.md](COORDINATION-PLATFORM.md)**

Why individual action fails, coordination works. Platform mechanics for collective power.

**Evidence**: Congressional offices take meetings when 5,000+ constituents coordinate. One-off messages are ignored.

---

## 3. Organizing Reality

**[ORGANIZING-REALITY.md](ORGANIZING-REALITY.md)**

What organizing victories look like (KC tenants, union drives), why organizing fails (retaliation, surveillance), and class struggle infrastructure vs civic engagement theater.

**Key sections**:
- What wins: Rent strikes (247 days → rent caps), union drives (74% win rate), ballot initiatives ($15/hour in Missouri)
- Why it fails: Free rider problem, fear of retaliation (41.5% of union campaigns face illegal employer action), surveillance/infiltration
- What we build: Anonymous organizing tools, retaliation defense, counter-surveillance, persistent infrastructure

## 4. Viral Growth Strategy

**[viral-growth.md](viral-growth.md)**

Shareable impact cards, gamification, leaderboards, network visualization. Making civic action social currency.

**Implementation status**: Partial. Shareable cards exist, social proof implemented, full gamification/leaderboards not built.

**Why this coexists with organizing reality**: Two complementary approaches:
- **Viral growth**: Brings in NPR listeners, moderates, people new to civic action (breadth)
- **Organizing infrastructure**: Serves hardcore organizers facing retaliation (depth)

Both are necessary. Viral growth builds user base. Organizing tools serve people taking real risk.

## 5. Product Roadmap

**[roadmap.md](roadmap.md)**

Product milestones and timelines.

## Historical Context

**Docs that were consolidated or superseded**:
- WHAT-ACTUALLY-WORKS.md → Consolidated into ORGANIZING-REALITY.md (Part 1: Victories)
- WHAT-PEOPLE-ARE-ACTUALLY-ORGANIZING-AROUND.md → Consolidated into ORGANIZING-REALITY.md (Part 1: Research)
- THE-VEIL-UNPEELED.md → Consolidated into ORGANIZING-REALITY.md (Part 2: Failures)
- REALITY-GROUNDED-STRATEGY.md → Early synthesis that became ORGANIZING-REALITY.md

**Moved to other directories**:
- UNIVERSAL-DECISION-MAKER-VOICE.md → /docs/design/ (copy guidelines)
- UNIVERSAL-VOICE-RESTORED.md → /docs/design/ (copy fix log)

## Strategic Clarity

**Communiqué serves two audiences**:

1. **Mainstream users** (viral growth strategy):
   - Shareable impact cards, gamification, social proof
   - "Make civic action a status symbol"
   - Low-risk, high-volume participation
   - Congressional message campaigns

2. **Organizers** (class struggle infrastructure):
   - Anonymous union card signing, threshold signatures
   - Retaliation defense, mutual aid, legal support
   - High-risk, high-impact collective action
   - Rent strikes, union drives, ballot initiatives

Both strategies are valid. Both are necessary. They're not mutually exclusive.
