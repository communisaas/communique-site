# Organizing Reality: Victories, Failures, and Class Struggle Infrastructure

**What organizing actually looks like.** What wins, what fails, and why most people don't organize even when they should.

---

## Part 1: What Wins (Concrete Organizing Victories)

### Tenant Organizing

**Kansas City Independence Towers (June 2025)**:
- **247-day rent strike** - longest in KC history
- **Won**: Rent caps (studios $730, 1-beds $855, 2-beds $965)
- **Won**: Comprehensive pest extermination, HVAC repairs by Nov 2025
- **Won**: Formal recognition of tenant union (will renegotiate next year)
- **Won**: Zero back-rent owed, no retaliation clause
- **Tactic**: Collective withholding, union formation, formal contract

**Brooklyn 1616 President St. (January 2025)**:
- **Four-year rent strike**
- **Won**: $250,000 in waived rent
- **Won**: Judge-ordered repairs
- **Tactic**: Long-term collective action, legal system engagement

**Toronto (March 2025)**:
- **Corporate landlord rent strike**
- **Won**: Lower rents
- **Won**: Compensation for neglected repairs
- **Won**: Official recognition of tenant union
- **Tactic**: Organizing against financialized housing

**Pattern**: Rent strikes with formal union recognition are winning. Not just individual tenant rights, but **collective power institutionalized through union contracts**.

### Workplace Organizing

**Major Strike Wins (2024)**:
- **Boeing Machinists**: 38% wage increase over 4 years
- **Longshoremen (ILA)**: 62% pay increase over 6 years (3-day strike)
- **Southwest flight attendants (TWU)**: 22.3% raise by May 2025

**New Union Sectors**:
- **First unionized strippers** (Star Garden Topless Dive Bar, Hollywood - 17-0 vote)
- **First Trader Joe's, Apple stores, Chipotle** locations unionized
- **Starbucks**: Over 100 locations unionized following Buffalo win
- **Amazon Staten Island**: First warehouse unionized

**General Labor Trends**:
- **Workers voted 74% in favor of unions** (through April 2024, up from 69% in 2019)
- **Union petitions doubled during Biden years** (3,286 petitions FY2024, up 27% from 2023)
- **Union membership up 500,000** over last two years

**Pattern**: Strikes work. Short, strategic strikes (3 days for longshoremen) can win 62% raises. Sectors previously thought "unorganizable" are organizing (strippers, retail, tech).

### Ballot Initiatives (Direct Democracy)

**Missouri Prop A (November 2024)**:
- **Won**: $15/hour minimum wage
- **Won**: 7 days paid sick leave annually
- **Impact**: 500,000+ Missouri workers affected

**Alaska & Nebraska (November 2024)**:
- **Won**: Higher minimum wage, paid sick leave (Alaska)
- **Won**: Statewide paid sick leave (Nebraska)

**Pattern**: When workers can't win through legislatures, they bypass them with ballot initiatives. Winning on material needs: wages, sick leave, basic protections.

## Part 2: Why Organizing Fails

### The Free Rider Problem

**Rational individual incentives against organizing**:
- "Let someone else organize. If it works, I'll benefit anyway."
- "I can't afford to risk my job/housing/immigration status."
- "My contribution won't matter in a group this large."

**Group size effects**: Cooperation generally declines when group size increases. In larger groups people often feel less responsible for the common good and believe that their contribution does not matter.

**Social environment**: The majority of respondents adopt the norms of their environment. The vast majority of those who did not participate are from milieus that approve of their non-participation.

### Fear of Retaliation (Very Real)

**Workers: You Will Be Fired**
- **Employers charged with violating federal law in 41.5% of union campaigns**
- **1 in 5 union campaigns involves illegal firing** for union activity
- **54% of employees won't report misconduct** because "I fear retaliation" (#1 reason)
- **Common tactics**: Fire organizers, demote, reduce salary, reassign shifts, hire union-busting consultants (3 out of 4 campaigns), mandatory "captive audience" meetings (9 out of 10 campaigns)

**Tenants: You Will Be Evicted**
- **Retaliatory eviction is illegal in most states** - landlords do it anyway
- **Common tactics**: Terminate month-to-month tenancy, decrease services (lock laundry, drain pool, cancel security), increase rent, evict for trumped-up reasons (noise, "damage")
- **In practice**: Landlords evict, tenant has to go to court to prove retaliation, meanwhile they're homeless

**Immigrants: You Will Be Deported**
- **From February-May 2025, ICE detained 20,000 immigrants/month** (3x increase from 2024)
- **Arrests follow directive to arrest 3,000/day** (4x increase)
- **Impact**: "Many described being overwhelmed with fear and not leaving their homes"
- **Tactics**: Masked agents in plainclothes, workplace raids, target individuals who pose no threat to public safety

**All Organizers: You Will Be Surveilled, Infiltrated, Doxxed**
- **2017**: NYPD undercover officers infiltrated BLM activists, accessed private group texts
- **21 states criminalized aspects of peaceful protest since 2017**
- **Doxxing**: Right-wing groups compile private information, circulate to encourage harassment/violence, "swatting" (armed police dispatched to address)
- **Chilling effects**: Fear of plainclothes police, ICE officers, agents-provocateur discourages would-be marchers

### Organizational Collapse

**Lack of leadership and direction**: Grassroots movements without clear leadership often lack direction, leaving people aware of issues but uncertain what action to take.

**The horizontalism trap**: Horizontal leaderless organizations struggle to coordinate necessary action and control protests, while only disciplined, hierarchical organizations can turn protests on and off as a result of policy negotiations.

**External shocks**: One crisis (police crackdown, leader arrested, funding cut) can destroy months of organizing.

**Nonprofit capture**: The nonprofit industrial complex channels revolutionary energy into incremental service provision. Organizers burn out. The system absorbs dissent.

## Part 3: What Communiqué Should Actually Be

### Not Civic Engagement Theater

**Stop asking people to**:
- Contact representatives (they're ignored)
- Sign petitions (symbolic, no material impact)
- Share social media posts (performative)
- Engage with "democracy" (the system is broken)

**These don't deliver material improvements**. They might raise awareness, but they don't change rent, wages, or living conditions.

### Infrastructure for Class Struggle

**Build for what's actually working**:
1. **Tenant organizing**: Rent strike coordination, landlord databases, tenant union formation
2. **Workplace organizing**: Anonymous union card signing, threshold signatures, workplace violation crowdsourcing
3. **Ballot initiatives**: Signature collection coordination, volunteer matching, voter turnout tools
4. **Mutual aid**: Anonymous need matching, cryptographic reputation, decentralized treasuries

### What Our Cryptography Actually Solves

**Not**: "Make civic engagement shareable"

**Yes**:
1. **Anonymous organizing** - Workers can sign union cards without employers knowing
2. **Threshold signatures** - Reveal only when 50%+1 reached, can't single out early organizers
3. **Zero-knowledge proofs** - Prove you're a tenant/worker without revealing identity
4. **Encrypted coordination** - Landlords/employers/ICE can't infiltrate groups
5. **Decentralized infrastructure** - Can't be shut down by defunding one nonprofit

### The Real User Flow

**Not this**:
```
User enters address
  → "Contact your representative about housing policy"
  → Message sent
  → Representative ignores it
  → Nothing changes
```

**This**:
```
User enters address
  → "Your building is owned by ABC Holdings LLC"
  → "ABC Holdings owns 47 buildings in your neighborhood"
  → "Average rent increase: 34% over 3 years"
  → "37 other tenants in this building"
  → "23 have joined the tenant association"
  → [Join Association] [Start Rent Strike] [File Complaint]
```

## Part 4: Common Success Patterns

### Pattern 1: Collective Action > Individual Action
- **Rent strikes work** because whole buildings withhold together
- **Strikes work** because workers walk out together
- **Ballot initiatives work** because organizers collect signatures + turn out voters together
- Individual complaints, individual lawsuits, individual letters = minimal impact

### Pattern 2: Formal Recognition of Collective Power
- **KC tenants won union recognition** (landlord must negotiate with union)
- **Starbucks/Amazon workers won union certification** (employer must bargain)
- **Indigenous groups won land demarcation** (government formally recognizes sovereignty)
- Informal organizing → formal institutional power

### Pattern 3: Material Wins, Not Symbolic Wins
- **Rent caps** (specific dollar amounts)
- **Wage increases** (specific percentages)
- **Paid sick leave** (specific number of days)
- **Land protection** (specific territories)
- Not: "awareness raised", "petition signed", "message sent"

### Pattern 4: Long Timelines Are Normal
- **KC rent strike**: 247 days
- **Brooklyn rent strike**: 4 years
- **Mundurukú land rights**: 10+ years
- **Canadian migrant workers**: 45 years
- Quick wins are rare; persistence is essential

### Pattern 5: Multiple Tactics Simultaneously
- **KC tenants**: Rent withholding + union formation + legal strategy + media
- **Indiana grad workers**: Strikes + marches + protests + petitions
- **Swiss climate**: Litigation + citizen organizing + international solidarity
- No single tactic wins alone

## Part 5: Technical Implementation for Organizing

### Phase 1: Anonymity Infrastructure (Immediate)

**Problem**: Workers/tenants afraid to organize because they'll be identified and retaliated against

**Solution**:
- **Threshold signature union cards**: Workers sign anonymously, signatures revealed only when 50%+1 reached
- **ZK tenant verification**: Prove you live in building X without revealing which unit
- **Encrypted coordination**: Signal groups with TEE-based encryption

**Metric**: 10 organizing campaigns use our anonymity tools, 0 organizers identified before they're ready

### Phase 2: Power Mapping (3 months)

**Landlord/Employer Database**:
- Scrape public records (property ownership, corporate filings)
- Crowdsource data (tenant/worker reports)
- Anonymous submission via ZK proofs
- Show ownership structure, rent increases, violations, evictions

**Metric**: 10,000 tenants/workers can look up who actually owns their building/company

### Phase 3: Retaliation Defense (6 months)

**Problem**: Even with anonymity, retaliation happens (illegal firing, eviction, detention)

**Solution**:
- **Legal support matching**: Connect fired workers to labor lawyers who've won similar cases
- **Mutual aid rapid response**: Crowdfund rent/wages for retaliated organizers within 24 hours
- **Documentation infrastructure**: Cryptographically timestamped evidence of retaliation

**Metric**: 5 retaliated organizers get legal support + financial aid within 48 hours

### Phase 4: Persistent Infrastructure (12 months)

**Problem**: Movements collapse when funding dries up, organizers burn out, nonprofits defund radical work

**Solution**:
- **Decentralized mutual aid treasuries**: DAO-like structure, cryptographic consensus for fund distribution
- **Long-term relationship infrastructure**: CRM for organizing (tracks relationships over years, not weeks)
- **Victory documentation**: What actually worked, preserved cryptographically, can't be memory-holed

**Metric**: 3 organizing campaigns sustain for >2 years using our infrastructure

---

## Part 6: Why This Aligns with Phase 2 (Token Economics)

**Phase 1 (current)**: Build organizing infrastructure
- Landlord/employer databases
- Anonymous coordination tools
- Mutual aid networks
- Proven victories

**Phase 2 (12-18 months)**: Add token layer
- Reputation becomes on-chain
- Mutual aid pools become DAO treasuries
- Organizing victories get rewarded
- Platform becomes self-sustaining

**But Phase 2 only works if Phase 1 delivers real power.**

Can't tokenize impotence. Can only tokenize victory.

## Part 7: What This Requires Us to Accept

### We Will Be Targeted

**If our tools actually work**, landlords/employers/ICE will:
- Try to shut us down legally (DMCA, ToS violations, "facilitating illegal activity")
- Try to infiltrate us (police, fascists as users)
- Try to dox/swat us (we're organizers too)
- Try to defund us (payment processors, hosting providers)

**We need to**:
- Decentralize (so we can't be shut down)
- Stay anonymous ourselves (so we can't be targeted)
- Accept legal risk (building tools for illegal-but-just organizing)
- Be despised by power (landlords, employers, police, ICE, fascists will hate us)

### Most Campaigns Will Still Fail

**Cryptography solves**:
- Anonymity (ZK proofs, threshold signatures)
- Privacy (encryption)
- Trust without identity (cryptographic reputation)

**Cryptography doesn't solve**:
- Organizer burnout (still need to show up to meetings for years)
- Free rider problem (still rational not to participate)
- State violence (raids still happen even if you're anonymous)
- Economic coercion (still need rent money even if landlord doesn't know you're organizing)

**We also need**:
- Mutual aid (economic support)
- Political education (why organize despite risks)
- Community (so organizing isn't lonely)
- Victories (to prove it's worth it)

### The Only Question

Is reducing casualties and increasing win rate enough?

**Build tools that keep organizers alive. Then build tools that help them win.**

## Summary: Name the Enemy, Build Real Power

**Mamdani won because he said**:
- "Billionaire class"
- "Political dynasty"
- "Trump"

**We need to say**:
- "Your landlord"
- "Your boss"
- "Algorithmic rent-pricing software"
- "Private equity firms"

**People know who's fucking them over.** Stop pretending the enemy is "low voter turnout" or "political polarization."

The enemy is **people with power extracting wealth from people without power.**

**Real power is the ability to make someone more powerful than you do something they don't want to do.**

Congressional messages don't do that. Rent strikes do.

**That's what we should build.**
