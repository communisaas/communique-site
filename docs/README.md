## Two Audiences, One Application

Commons serves **people** and **organizations** through the same platform.

**Person-facing** (verified civic speech): identity verification, spatial browse, postal bubble, power landscape, debate markets, proofs. A person uses commons.email to send a verified letter to their representative.

**Org-facing** (advocacy infrastructure): mass email, campaigns, list management, analytics, billing, multi-tenancy. An organization uses commons.email to mobilize supporters and deliver verified constituent signals at scale.

The org layer is what directly competes with Action Network, EveryAction, and Quorum — but it's built on top of the person layer, which none of them have.
