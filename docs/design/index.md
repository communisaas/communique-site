# Design Documentation

**Design system and voice for Communiqué.**

---

## Start Here

### [design-system.md](design-system.md) — The Design System

**Philosophy, color, typography, motion, components.**

Start here. Everything else references this.

### [voice.md](voice.md) — Voice & Language

**How Communiqué speaks.** Pragmatic cypherpunk. Direct. No corporate speak.

### [TYPOGRAPHY-SYSTEM.md](TYPOGRAPHY-SYSTEM.md) — Typography Implementation

**Satoshi + JetBrains Mono.** Font loading, Tailwind classes, migration guide.

---

## UX Patterns

Specific solutions for common design challenges.

### [patterns/location-filtering.md](patterns/location-filtering.md)

Location as filter, not category. Progressive precision. No "campaigns in."

### [patterns/template-discovery.md](patterns/template-discovery.md)

Template browsing, filtering, recommendation UX.

### [patterns/privacy-governance.md](patterns/privacy-governance.md)

Privacy-preserving governance UI. Zero-knowledge patterns.

### [patterns/identity-verification.md](patterns/identity-verification.md)

Identity verification flows. "Stealthily cypherpunk."
