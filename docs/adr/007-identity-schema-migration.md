# ADR 007: Identity Verification Schema Migration

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-01-23

## Context

The identity verification system is fully implemented in code (`src/lib/core/server/identity-hash.ts`, `src/routes/api/identity/verify/+server.ts`, `src/routes/api/identity/didit/webhook/+server.ts`) but the database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` was missing required fields. This created a critical gap where the verification API routes would fail at runtime when attempting to store or query identity verification data.

### The Problem

Both self.xyz and Didit verification flows require storing:
1. **identity_hash** - For Sybil resistance (duplicate detection)
2. **identity_fingerprint** - For audit-safe logging
3. **birth_year** - For age verification without storing full DOB

The code was attempting to:
- Query `user.identity_hash` for duplicate detection
- Update users with these fields after verification
- Create VerificationAudit records with identity data

But the schema only had basic verification fields (`is_verified`, `verification_method`, `verified_at`, `verification_data`).

## Decision

Add the following fields and models to `prisma/schema.prisma`:

### User Model Additions

```prisma
// === SYBIL RESISTANCE FIELDS (Phase 1A Identity Verification) ===
identity_hash             String?    @unique @map("identity_hash")
identity_fingerprint      String?    @map("identity_fingerprint")
birth_year                Int?       @map("birth_year")

// === VERIFICATION RATE LIMITING (Phase 1A) ===
verification_attempts     Int        @default(0) @map("verification_attempts")
verification_cooldown_until DateTime? @map("verification_cooldown_until")
```

### New Models

```prisma
model VerificationAudit {
  // Tracks all verification attempts for fraud detection and compliance
}

model VerificationSession {
  // Ephemeral sessions for self.xyz and Didit verification flows
}
```

## Privacy-Preserving Design

### Identity Hash (Sybil Resistance)

The `identity_hash` field stores a SHA-256 hash computed from:
- Passport/document number (normalized: uppercase, no spaces/hyphens)
- Nationality (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
- Birth year
- Document type
- Platform salt (environment variable)

**Security Properties:**
- **Deterministic:** Same identity always produces the same hash
- **Collision-resistant:** SHA-256 provides cryptographic security
- **One-way:** Cannot reverse-engineer document number from hash
- **Salted:** Platform secret prevents rainbow table attacks

**Privacy Guarantee:** We never store plaintext passport numbers or full dates of birth. Only the hash is stored, which is useless without the platform salt.

### Identity Fingerprint (Audit Logging)

The `identity_fingerprint` is the first 16 characters of the identity hash. This provides:
- Sufficient uniqueness for audit log correlation
- Safe for logging (not enough entropy to reverse lookup)
- Useful for support debugging without exposing full hash

### Birth Year (Age Verification)

Storing only the birth year (not full date of birth) provides:
- Sufficient data for 18+ age verification
- Minimal PII exposure (year-only granularity)
- GDPR/CCPA compliant data minimization

## Uniqueness Index

The `identity_hash` field has a `@unique` constraint, which:
1. Prevents the same person from verifying multiple accounts
2. Enables efficient duplicate detection queries
3. Enforces Sybil resistance at the database level

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Users

All new fields are **nullable** (optional):
- `identity_hash String?` - NULL until user completes verification
- `identity_fingerprint String?` - NULL until user completes verification
- `birth_year Int?` - NULL until user completes verification

This allows:
- Existing users to continue using the platform
- Gradual migration as users verify their identity
- No forced verification for existing accounts

### New Users

New users can optionally complete identity verification, which will:
1. Call self.xyz or Didit verification flow
2. Generate identity hash from verified document
3. Check for duplicates against existing hashes
4. Store hash, fingerprint, and birth year
5. Update `is_verified = true`

## Rate Limiting

To prevent verification abuse:
- `verification_attempts` tracks failed attempts
- `verification_cooldown_until` enforces cooldown after multiple failures

Default behavior:
- 3 failed attempts trigger 24-hour cooldown
- Configurable via environment variables

## Audit Trail

`VerificationAudit` provides complete audit trail:
- All verification attempts (success/failure)
- Failure reasons (age, duplicate, invalid proof)
- IP address hash (fraud detection)
- SDK metadata (sanitized, no PII)

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Sybil Resistance:** One identity per account enforcement
2. **Privacy Preserved:** No PII stored, only cryptographic derivatives
3. **Audit Compliance:** Complete verification audit trail
4. **Backward Compatible:** Existing users unaffected

### Negative

1. **Database Size:** Additional columns and indexes
2. **Query Overhead:** Unique index on identity_hash
3. **Environment Dependency:** Requires IDENTITY_HASH_SALT secret

### Risks

1. **Salt Rotation:** Changing the salt invalidates all existing hashes
   - Mitigation: Never rotate salt without a migration plan
2. **Hash Collisions:** Theoretically possible but cryptographically negligible
   - Mitigation: SHA-256 provides 2^256 possible outputs
