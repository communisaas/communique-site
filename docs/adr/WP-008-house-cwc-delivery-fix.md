# WP-008: Fix CWC House Delivery

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Critical
**Complexity:** High (3-4 days estimated)

---

## Problem Statement

House of Representatives submissions via CWC (Communicating With Congress) were **silently simulated** instead of actually delivered. Users received fake success confirmations with message IDs like `HOUSE-SIM-${Date.now()}`, believing their messages were sent to their representatives when they were not.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **House CWC API Requires IP Whitelisting**
   - Senate CWC API: Direct access with API key ✅ Working
   - House CWC API: Requires IP address whitelisting from House vendor program ❌ Not configured
   - Reference: https://www.house.gov/doing-business-with-the-house/communicating-with-congress-cwc
   - Contact: CWCVendors@mail.house.gov

2. **Hardcoded Proxy Fallback**
   - Code attempted to use GCP proxy at `34.171.151.252:8080` (hardcoded hackathon solution)
   - When proxy failed, code silently fell back to `simulateHouseSubmission()`
   - Simulation returned `success: true` with fake message ID
   - No visible error to users or operators

3. **Impact**
   - Users thought they contacted House representatives
   - Messages were never actually delivered
   - Silent failure violated user trust
   - Audit identified as critical technical debt

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Silent Simulation Fallback

**File:** `/src/lib/core/congress/cwc-client.ts`

**Changes:**
- ❌ Deleted `simulateHouseSubmission()` method entirely
- ❌ Removed fallback to simulation on proxy failure
- ✅ House submissions now **FAIL CLEARLY** when not configured
- ✅ Error messages explain IP whitelisting requirement and provide contact info

**Before:**
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.error('House CWC submission error:', error);
  // If proxy fails, fall back to simulation for hackathon demo
  return this.simulateHouseSubmission(representative);
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.error('[CWC House] Submission error:', {
    office: representative.name,
    bioguideId: representative.bioguideId,
    error: errorMessage,
    timestamp
  });

  return {
    success: false,
    status: 'failed',
    error: 'House CWC submission failed: [detailed error with troubleshooting]'
  };
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling

**Configuration Missing:**
```typescript
if (!proxyUrl) {
  return {
    success: false,
    status: 'failed',
    error: [
      'House CWC delivery not configured.',
      'House of Representatives requires IP whitelisting for CWC API access.',
      'To enable House submissions:',
      '1. Apply for CWC vendor program: https://...',
      '2. Contact CWCVendors@mail.house.gov',
      '3. Configure GCP_PROXY_URL environment variable',
      'Alternative: Use representative contact forms.'
    ].join(' ')
  };
}
```

**Network/Proxy Errors:**
- 401/403: "Proxy authentication failed. Check GCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN."
- 404: "Proxy endpoint not found. Verify GCP_PROXY_URL is correct."
- 429: "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
- 500+: "Proxy server error. This may be temporary."
- Network errors: "The proxy server may be unreachable or down."

### 3. Enhanced Logging

**Structured logging with `[CWC House]` prefix:**
- Configuration errors
- Proxy connection attempts
- Submission successes/failures
- All logs include: office name, bioguideId, district, timestamp

**Example log output:**
```javascript
[CWC House] Configuration missing: {
  office: 'Nancy Pelosi',
  bioguideId: 'P000197',
  district: 'CA-12',
  error: 'GCP_PROXY_URL not configured',
  timestamp: '2026-01-26T03:30:10.769Z'
}
```

### 4. Updated Documentation

**Files Updated:**
- `src/lib/core/congress/cwc-client.ts` - Header comments with IP whitelisting explanation
- `.env.example` - Detailed comments about House CWC requirements
- `docs/guides/production-secrets-checklist.md` - Updated proxy configuration section
- `src/lib/core/legislative/adapters/cwc/cwcAdapter.ts` - Added implementation notes

**Key Documentation Points:**
- House vs Senate CWC API differences
- IP whitelisting requirement from House vendor program
- How to apply for CWC vendor status
- Configuration options (direct API, proxy, contact forms)
- Clear statement: "Without configuration, House submissions FAIL"

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

**New Test File:** `/tests/unit/cwc-house-delivery.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Fails clearly when `GCP_PROXY_URL` not configured
- ✅ Error messages include IP whitelisting info
- ✅ No fake message IDs (no `HOUSE-SIM-*`)
- ✅ Logs configuration errors with details
- ✅ Includes representative details in error logs
- ✅ Rejects Senate representatives (chamber validation)
- ✅ Uses consistent `[CWC House]` log prefix
- ✅ Includes timestamps in all logs

**Test Results:** ✅ All tests passing (8/8)

## Environment Variables

### Before (Misleading)
```bash
# Hardcoded IP from hackathon
GCP_PROXY_URL=http://34.171.151.252:8080
GCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-gcp-proxy-auth-token
```

### After (Clear Requirements)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: House CWC API requires IP whitelisting from Congress
# Apply at: https://www.house.gov/doing-business-with-the-house/communicating-with-congress-cwc
# Contact: CWCVendors@mail.house.gov
#
# Options for House delivery:
# 1. Direct API (requires whitelisted server IP) - not available in most deployments
# 2. GCP proxy server (requires proxy with whitelisted IP) - configure below
# 3. Contact forms (fallback - not yet implemented)
#
# If not configured, House submissions will FAIL with clear error messages
# (Senate submissions work without proxy - they use CWC_API_KEY above)
GCP_PROXY_URL=http://your-whitelisted-proxy-server:8080
GCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-gcp-proxy-auth-token
```

## Production Deployment Considerations

### Current Status
- **Senate submissions:** ✅ Working (direct API with CWC_API_KEY)
- **House submissions:** ❌ Will fail clearly (IP whitelisting required)

### Options for Enabling House Delivery

**Option 1: Apply for House CWC Vendor Program (Recommended)**
1. Apply at https://www.house.gov/doing-business-with-the-house/communicating-with-congress-cwc
2. Email CWCVendors@mail.house.gov with:
   - Organization information
   - Use case description
   - IP addresses to whitelist
3. Wait for approval (timeline varies)
4. Configure `GCP_PROXY_URL` (if using proxy) OR deploy on whitelisted IP

**Option 2: Deploy Proxy Server on Whitelisted IP**
1. Get IP address whitelisted (see Option 1)
2. Deploy proxy server on that IP
3. Configure `GCP_PROXY_URL` and `GCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN`

**Option 3: Implement Contact Form Fallback (Future)**
- Use representative's contact form instead of CWC API
- Requires web scraping or form automation
- Not yet implemented

### Interim Messaging to Users

**When House submission fails:**
```
"House of Representatives submissions require special approval from Congress.
We're working on getting certified. In the meantime, you can contact your
representative directly at: [contact form link]"
```

## Testing Instructions

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- tests/unit/cwc-house-delivery.test.ts
```

**Expected:** All 8 tests pass
- Configuration errors return clear failures
- Error messages include IP whitelisting info
- Logs use `[CWC House]` prefix
- No simulation fallback

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm test -- tests/integration/congressional-delivery-e2e.test.ts
```

**Note:** CWC submission tests are currently skipped (pending MSW mock improvements)

### Manual Testing

**Test 1: Configuration Missing**
```bash
# Unset proxy URL
unset GCP_PROXY_URL

# Attempt House submission
# Expected: Clear failure with IP whitelisting instructions
```

**Test 2: Invalid Proxy**
```bash
export GCP_PROXY_URL=http://invalid-proxy:9999

# Attempt House submission
# Expected: Network error with troubleshooting guidance
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never simulate success in production code**
   - Silent failures erode user trust
   - Always fail clearly with actionable error messages

2. **Document external API requirements upfront**
   - IP whitelisting is a common requirement for government APIs
   - Should have been documented in initial architecture

3. **Hardcoded values are technical debt**
   - `34.171.151.252:8080` was a hackathon shortcut
   - Should use environment variables from the start

4. **Test for failure modes, not just success**
   - Original tests only checked success paths
   - Failure path testing revealed silent simulation

5. **Structured logging aids debugging**
   - Consistent `[CWC House]` prefix makes log filtering easy
   - Including office/bioguideId/district helps trace issues
