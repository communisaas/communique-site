# Location Intelligence & Privacy

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED | Privacy-by-Architecture with Progressive Signal Inference

---

**The server never knows a user's exact address. Location is inferred progressively, stored client-side, and revealed only through user action.**

## Design Principle

Location data follows a one-way funnel: raw signals enter, only derived facts (district codes, hashes) leave the privacy boundary. The server learns location implicitly — through which templates a user selects — not through direct disclosure.

---

## Signal Types

Six location signals, ranked by confidence:

| Signal | Confidence | Granularity | Storage | Expiry |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| IP Geolocation | 0.2 | State only | Client (IndexedDB) | 24h |
| Browser Geolocation | 0.6 | Congressional district | Client (IndexedDB) | 7d |
| OAuth Profile | 0.8 | State/city | Client (IndexedDB) | 90d |
| User Selected | 0.9 | Congressional district | Client (IndexedDB) | 90d |
| Behavioral Patterns | 0.9 | Congressional district | Client (IndexedDB) | 30d |
| Identity Verification (mDL) | 1.0 | Congressional district | Server (hash only) | 365d |

The `user_selected` signal comes from the interactive location breadcrumb, where users explicitly choose their location. High confidence because it reflects direct user intent.

### IP Geolocation Constraints

IP can **only** determine state (not congressional district). This is enforced at the type system level:

```typescript
IPLocationSignal.congressional_district = null  // Type system prevents false precision
```

IP coordinates are city-center approximations. Using them for district lookup would produce false precision and wrong results (congressional districts don't align with city boundaries).

**Implementation**: Cloudflare native geolocation (zero-latency) → fallback to GeoLite2 database.

## Data Flow

```
User enters address (onboarding)
    ↓
Client-Side Resolution (Census API / Shadow Atlas)
├── Resolves all 14 governance layers
└── Stores in IndexedDB (NEVER transmitted to server)
    ↓
Server-Side: Implicit Disclosure Only
├── User selects template → server learns location from template tags
├── User submits congressional proof → district HASH revealed
└── User clicks local template → server infers city/county/state
    ↓
Privacy Boundary
├── Exact address: stays in browser
├── Cell ID (Census block): only in ZK proofs as private witness
└── District: revealed through action or cryptographic proof
    ↓
Message Delivery
├── Federal (CWC): address sent to Congress (required for delivery)
├── State/Local: mailto opens user's email client (address stays local)
└── Platform sees: template ID, timestamp, inferred location level
```

## What's Stored Where

### Client-Side Only (IndexedDB)

- Full address (street, city, state, ZIP)
- GPS coordinates
- All 14 resolved district codes
- Location signal history

### Server-Side (Minimal)

| Field | Model | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `district_hash` | User | SHA-256 of congressional district (not plaintext) |
| `address_verified_at` | User | Timestamp of verification |
| `address_verification_method` | User | `'civic_api'` / `'postal'` / `'mdl'` |
| `identity_hash` | User | SHA-256 of identity attributes (sybil resistance) |

**No server-side storage of**: street address, city, state, ZIP code, GPS coordinates, Census block ID.

---

## Governance Layers

The system resolves 14 governance layers from a single address:

| Slot | Layer | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Congressional District | CA-12 |
| 1 | Federal Senate | CA |
| 2 | State Senate | SD-11 |
| 3 | State House | AD-17 |
| 4 | County | 06075 (San Francisco) |
| 5 | City | San Francisco |
| 6 | City Council | District 5 |
| 7 | School (Unified) | SFUSD |
| 8 | School (Elementary) | — |
| 9 | School (Secondary) | — |
| 10-12 | Special Districts | Water, Fire, Transit |
| 13 | Voting Precinct | PCT-3721 |

All 14 stored as SHA-256 hashes in ZK proofs. Plaintext districts stay client-side.

---

## Privacy Boundaries

### mDL Verification

When a user verifies identity via mobile driver's license:

1. HPKE decrypt → CBOR decode → COSE_Sign1 verify against IACA roots
2. Extract address fields (postal_code, city, state)
3. Resolve congressional district
4. **Discard address fields** — only district leaves the boundary
5. Store `district_hash` (SHA-256) on User record

Raw address fields enter as input. Only the district hash exits.

### ZK Proofs

District proofs use Poseidon2 hashing:
- Identity commitment: `H(identity_commitment, user_entropy)`
- Nullifier: `Poseidon(user_secret, campaign_id, epoch_id)` — prevents double-voting
- Proof reveals 14 district hashes, no plaintext

### CWC Congressional Delivery

The one exception where address is transmitted: CWC (Congress) requires constituent address for delivery. This is:
- Encrypted in transit (TLS)
- Sent directly to congressional office systems
- Not stored by Commons after delivery

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Template selection leakage | Medium | Action-based only; users can browse without revealing location |
| False precision from IP | High | Type system enforces `congressional_district = null` for IP signals |
| Cell ID exposure | High | Census block (600-3000 people) treated as PII; encrypted, never logged |
| Behavioral profiling | Medium | Client-side only; no server-side profile construction |
| CWC address transmission | Low | Required by Congress; encrypted; not retained by Commons |
| VPN/proxy circumvention | Low | Accepted limitation; IP used only for state-level filtering |
| Verification metadata leakage | Low | All methods produce same output (district hash); method doesn't leak additional info |

---

## Multi-Country Support

District configuration is polymorphic:

| Country | Primary District | Config |
|---|---|---|
| US | Congressional District | 14 governance layers |
| GB | Parliamentary Constituency | — |
| FR | Circonscription législative | — |
| JP | Senkyoku (選挙区) | — |
| BR | Distrito eleitoral | — |

Implementation: `src/lib/core/location/district-config.ts`
