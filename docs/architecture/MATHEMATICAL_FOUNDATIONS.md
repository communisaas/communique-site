## 1. **Percolation Theory: Network Failure & Information Cascades**

### **The Mathematical Foundation**
**Percolation theory** (Broadbent & Hammersley, 1957) provides rigorous mathematical analysis of **phase transitions** in network connectivity. This is the proven mathematics behind:
- **Internet backbone resilience** (AT&T, Google network engineering)
- **Power grid failure cascades** (electrical engineering)
- **Social media viral spread** (Facebook, Twitter algorithms)

### **Key Mathematical Results**
```
Critical Threshold Theorem (Kesten, 1980):
P(infinite cluster exists) = 0 for p < pc
P(infinite cluster exists) = 1 for p > pc

Exponential Decay (Aizenman & Barsky, 1987):
P(cluster size = n) ~ e^(-n/Œæ) for p < pc
```

**What this means for civic information:**
- **Information cascades** have mathematically proven **threshold effects**
- Below threshold: localized discussion, finite reach
- Above threshold: **viral spread** across entire network
- **Universal exponents** = scale-invariant behavior (works from neighborhoods to nations)

### **Implementation in Our System**
```typescript

  // Use proven percolation algorithms to find critical probability
  return percolationThreshold(network.adjacencyMatrix, network.edgeWeights);
}
```

  fuseInformation(sources: InformationSource[]): FusionResult {
    const cohomology = calculateCechCohomology(sources);
    if (cohomology.H1.rank > 0) {
      return { consistent: false, obstructions: cohomology.H1 };
    }
