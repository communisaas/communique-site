   - AMD EPYC processors
   - $40.71 - $61.68/month (region-dependent)

2. **Confidential VM Surcharge**:
   - Additional flat per-vCPU costs (AMD SEV or SEV-SNP)
   - Additional flat per-GB costs
   - Varies by technology (SEV vs SEV-SNP)
   - Exact surcharge not publicly listed in search results
   - Must use GCP Pricing Calculator for accurate totals

3. **Confidential Space Service**:
   - **No additional charge** (confirmed by GCP documentation)
   - Only billed for underlying Confidential VM resources

**Estimated Total (n2d-standard-2 + Confidential VM):**

## FREE Tier Deep Dive

### AWS FREE Tier (t4g.small)

**Eligibility:**
- Available through **December 31, 2025**
- 750 hours/month FREE (enough for 24/7 operation)
- Applies to t4g instances (ARM Graviton2)

**Instance Specs (t4g.small):**
- 2 vCPUs
- 2 GB RAM
- ARM Graviton2 processors
- Supports Nitro Enclaves

**Use Cases:**
- ✅ Development environments
- ✅ Staging environments
- ✅ Testing ZK proof generation
- ✅ Testing CBOR attestation parsing
- ⚠️ Production (limited by 2 GB RAM)

**Cost Savings:**
```
t4g.small on-demand: $0.0168/hour
FREE tier discount: 750 hours/month
Monthly savings: $0.0168 × 750 = $12.60
Annual savings (through Dec 2025): $12.60 × 12 = $151.20
```

**Important Notes:**
- FREE tier expires Dec 31, 2025 (14 months from now)
- After expiration, t4g.small costs $12.26/month (still cheaper than GCP)
- Can upgrade to c6g.large for production after testing

---

### GCP FREE Tier

**Confidential Computing:**
- ❌ **Not available** - No free tier for Confidential VMs
- ❌ Cannot use e2-micro (GCP's free tier) with Confidential Space
- ❌ Must pay full hourly rate from day one

**GCP Free Tier (non-Confidential):**
- e2-micro (0.25 vCPU, 1 GB RAM)
- **Not applicable** to Confidential Space workloads

---

## Migration Cost Analysis

### One-Time Migration Costs

**GCP → AWS Migration:**
- Developer time: ~8-16 hours (TEE provider refactoring)
- Testing time: ~4-8 hours (attestation verification, E2E encryption)
- Documentation updates: ~2-4 hours
- **Total labor**: 14-28 hours

**Estimated labor cost** (at $100/hour): $1,400 - $2,800

**Break-even analysis:**
```
Monthly savings: $60-85 (GCP) - $55-60 (AWS) = $5-25/month
Break-even: $2,800 / $25 = 112 months (worst case)
Break-even: $1,400 / $25 = 56 months (best case)
```

**With FREE tier (first 14 months):**
```
Monthly savings: $60-85 (GCP) - $0 (AWS) = $60-85/month
Break-even: $2,800 / $85 = 33 months
Break-even: $1,400 / $60 = 23 months
```

**Recommendation:** Migration pays for itself within 2-3 years on cost alone. **Security benefits justify immediate migration.**
