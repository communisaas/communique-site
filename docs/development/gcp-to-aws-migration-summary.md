# GCP → AWS Nitro Migration Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Decision:** Switch from GCP Confidential Space (AMD SEV-SNP) to AWS Nitro Enclaves (ARM Graviton)
**Reason:** Avoid Intel ME/AMD PSP management engine backdoor risks

---

## Files Updated Across Both Repos

### Communiqué Repository

**Core Documentation:**
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Updated TEE references from GCP to AWS Nitro
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated all TEE mentions (5 locations)
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md` - Updated Week 13-14 plan, costs, risks + added NSA uncertainty disclaimer

**Voter Protocol Repository:**

**Core Specs:**
- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Updated executive summary, Phase 1 description, complete E2E encryption flow diagram
  - Changed: GCP Confidential Space → AWS Nitro Enclaves
  - Changed: AMD SEV-SNP → ARM Graviton hypervisor-isolated
  - Changed: OIDC tokens → CBOR attestation documents
  - Added: Security caveats about NSA backdoor uncertainty

---

## Key Language Changes

### Before (GCP Confidential Space):
```
"GCP Confidential Space (AMD SEV-SNP TEE)"
"AMD SEV-SNP hardware-encrypted memory"
"OIDC attestation tokens"
"Google CA root verification"
```

### After (AWS Nitro Enclaves):
```
"AWS Nitro Enclaves (ARM-based TEE, no Intel ME/AMD PSP)"
"ARM Graviton hypervisor-isolated memory"
"CBOR attestation documents"
"AWS certificate chain verification"

+ Security Note: AWS Nitro avoids x86 management engines but relies
  on AWS hypervisor trust. Independently audited (Aug 2025), but
  absolute certainty about NSA backdoors is impossible. ARM architecture
  + auditable components reduce but don't eliminate state-actor risk.
```

## Technical Changes

### Attestation Format

**Before (GCP OIDC):**
```json
{
  "iss": "https://confidentialcomputing.googleapis.com",
  "submods": {
    "container": {
      "image_digest": "sha256:..."
    }
  },
  "hwmodel": "GCP_AMD_SEV"
}
```

**After (AWS CBOR):**
```json
{
  "module_id": "i-xxx-encXXX",
  "pcrs": {
    "0": "...",  // Boot measurement
    "1": "...",  // Kernel measurement
    "2": "...",  // Application measurement (enclave image)
    "8": "..."   // Kernel + app measurement
  },
  "certificate": "...",
  "cabundle": ["..."]
}
```

### Isolation Model

**Before (Hardware-Based):**
- AMD SEV-SNP encrypts VM memory at hardware level
- Relies on AMD PSP firmware (proprietary, unauditable)
- Trust model: Trust AMD CPU manufacturer

**After (Hypervisor-Based):**
- AWS Nitro Hypervisor isolates enclave memory
- No reliance on CPU manufacturer features
- Trust model: Trust AWS hypervisor (audited, partially open-source)
- ARM architecture avoids Intel ME/AMD PSP entirely

### Cost Comparison

**Detailed cost analysis:** See `docs/development/gcp-vs-aws-cost-comparison.md`

| Item | GCP Confidential Space | AWS Nitro Enclaves |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Base Instance** | n2d-standard-2 (2 vCPU, 8 GB) | c6g.large (2 vCPU, 4 GB) |
| **CPU Architecture** | AMD EPYC (x86) | ARM Graviton2 |
| **Base Instance Cost** | $40.71 - $61.68/month | $49.92/month |
| **TEE Surcharge** | Yes (per-vCPU + per-GB, amount not publicly listed) | None |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | ~$60-85/month | ~$55-60/month |
| **FREE Tier** | None | 750 hrs/mo (t4g.small) through Dec 2025 |
| **Effective Cost (2025)** | $60-85/month | $0 with FREE tier |
| **Cost Transparency** | Poor (surcharges hidden) | Excellent (no surcharges) |
| **12-Month TCO** | $2,490 | $1,203 |
| **Savings with AWS** | - | **52% cheaper ($1,287 savings)** |

## Security Posture Changes

### Backdoor Risk Assessment

| Attack Vector | GCP (AMD SEV-SNP) | AWS Nitro (ARM) |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Intel ME** | N/A (uses AMD) | ✅ Not present (ARM) |
| **AMD PSP** | ⚠️ Present, required | ✅ Not present (ARM) |
| **Network Access** | 🟢 None | 🟢 None |
| **Physical Access** | 🟡 Requires datacenter | 🟡 Requires datacenter |
| **Hypervisor** | 🟢 SEV-SNP bypasses | ⚠️ Trust required |
| **NSA Backdoor** | 🟡 AMD PSP unknown | 🟡 AWS infrastructure unknown |
| **Independent Audit** | ❌ None | ✅ Yes (Aug 2025) |

### Trust Chain Comparison

**GCP Trust Chain:**
1. Trust AMD (CPU manufacturer)
2. Trust AMD PSP firmware (closed-source)
3. Trust Google Cloud infrastructure
4. Trust GCP attestation service

**AWS Trust Chain:**
1. Trust AWS (cloud provider)
2. Trust AWS Nitro Hypervisor (partially open-source)
3. Trust ARM CPU cores (standard Neoverse, no secret features)
4. Trust AWS certificate authority

**Winner:** AWS Nitro - Fewer proprietary components, independently audited

## NSA Backdoor Uncertainty Disclaimer

**Added to all relevant documentation:**

> **Security Caveat:** While AWS Nitro Enclaves avoid x86 management engine backdoors (Intel ME, AMD PSP) and have been independently audited (August 2025), we cannot provide absolute certainty about NSA backdoor absence. Users must trust AWS hypervisor infrastructure. ARM architecture + auditable open-source components reduce but don't eliminate state-actor risk.

**Reasoning:**
- Intel ME has known network access and remote exploitability
- AMD PSP is closed-source, cannot verify no backdoors
- AWS Nitro is independently audited but requires hypervisor trust
- ARM architecture lacks equivalent to ME/PSP
- No system can guarantee 100% NSA-proof security

**Transparency:** We are honest about limitations. Users can make informed decisions.

## Key Benefits of Migration

1. ✅ **No Intel ME/AMD PSP** - ARM architecture avoids x86 management engines entirely
2. ✅ **Independent Audit** - Third-party verification of security claims (Aug 2025)
3. ✅ **Production-Proven** - Coinbase uses Nitro Enclaves for crypto wallet security
4. ✅ **Open-Source Components** - Key Nitro components are publicly auditable
5. ✅ **FREE Tier** - $0 cost through Dec 2025 (750 hrs/month on t4g.small)
6. ✅ **Cloud-Agnostic** - Our abstraction layer makes switching providers easy

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Trust is multi-layered** - No single technology eliminates all backdoor risk
2. **Transparency matters** - Document security trade-offs honestly
3. **Abstraction pays off** - Cloud-agnostic design makes migrations easy
4. **Audits add credibility** - Independent verification (AWS Aug 2025) > vendor claims
5. **ARM is promising** - Avoiding x86 management engines reduces attack surface
6. **RISC-V is future** - When cloud providers offer RISC-V, we can migrate again

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implement AWS provider** - Complete `src/lib/core/tee/providers/aws.ts`
2. **Test with FREE tier** - Validate architecture before production spend
3. **Update deployment docs** - Create AWS-specific guide
4. **Archive GCP docs** - Move to `docs/archive/` for reference
