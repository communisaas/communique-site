# What Actually Works: A Strategy for the Darkness

**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Context**: After reading Zohran Mamdani's victory speech
**Reality**: Things are so broken that "civic engagement" is a joke

---

## The Previous Strategy Was Bullshit

I wrote a growth strategy about gamification, leaderboards, viral coefficients. Shareable impact cards. "Make civic action a status symbol."

**That was written for people who still believe the system works.**

For NPR listeners. For people who think sending a congressional message matters. For the 3% who already engage with Democracy.io and Resistbot.

**But the system is completely fucking broken.**

And the 97% of people who don't engage? They're not wrong. They're **correct**.

---

## What Mamdani's Speech Reveals

### The Real Analysis

Read between the lines of that victory speech:

1. **"The billionaire class has sought to convince those making $30 an hour that their enemies are those earning $20 an hour."**
   - The system is designed to divide us
   - It's working exactly as intended
   - Civic engagement theater doesn't challenge this

2. **"Too many working people cannot recognize themselves in our party."**
   - Democrats became mediocre, cautious, disconnected
   - Traditional politics operates ON people, not WITH them
   - People stopped engaging because engagement became pointless

3. **"Every door knocked, every petition signature earned"**
   - 100,000 volunteers
   - Grassroots mobilization defeated a political dynasty
   - BUT: This required a candidate who named the enemy

4. **"To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us."**
   - Direct confrontation with Trump
   - Not civility politics
   - Not "reach across the aisle"
   - Named the threat explicitly

### What This Means for Communiqué

**If we build another civic engagement tool, we're part of the problem.**

We're selling false hope. We're asking people to participate in a system designed to ignore them. We're gamifying impotence.

**The question isn't "how do we make civic action shareable?"**

**The question is: "What do people actually need when the system has abandoned them?"**

## What Has Never Changed: Human Needs

Strip away the historical moment. What do people need?

### 1. Material Security
- Affordable housing
- Healthcare
- Childcare
- Food
- Not dying

**Not**: "Contact your representative about housing policy"
**But**: "Here are the 47 landlords who own 60% of rental housing in your neighborhood"

### 2. Dignity
- To be seen
- To be heard
- To not be humiliated by systems
- To have agency

**Not**: "You sent a message! +10 reputation points"
**But**: "Your building organized, rent strike starts Monday, legal aid is at this number"

### 3. Community
- Belonging to something larger
- Mutual aid
- Solidarity
- Protection from threats

**Not**: "Join our platform, invite 5 friends for a badge"
**But**: "37 people in your building, here's the Signal group, meeting is Thursday"

### 4. Power
- Ability to change conditions
- Control over their lives
- Collective strength
- Victory

**Not**: "Check your dashboard to see your impact"
**But**: "We stopped the eviction, landlord backed down, here's the victory party"

### 5. Truth
- Understanding what's actually happening
- Who the real enemies are
- Why things are broken
- What would actually work

**Not**: "Civics 101: How a bill becomes a law"
**But**: "Your rent is $3,200 because BlackRock bought your building in 2019 and uses algorithmic pricing software"

---

## The Real Strategy: Build Infrastructure for Class Struggle

### What Communiqué Could Actually Be

**Not a civic engagement platform.**

**A mutual aid coordination system with cryptographic guarantees.**

### Phase 1: Make Power Visible

**Stop asking people to contact their representatives.**

**Start showing them who actually has power and how it's used.**

#### Tool 1: Landlord Database
- Every rental building in the city
- Ownership structure (often hidden behind LLCs)
- Rent increases over time
- Eviction records
- Code violations
- Property tax breaks

**User flow**:
```
User enters address
  → "Your building is owned by ABC Holdings LLC"
  → "ABC Holdings is controlled by XYZ Capital"
  → "XYZ Capital owns 47 buildings in your neighborhood"
  → "Average rent increase: 34% over 3 years"
  → "37 other tenants in this building"
  → "23 have joined the tenant association"
  → [Join Association] [Start Rent Strike] [File Complaint]
```

**Why this works**:
- Makes invisible power visible
- Shows you're not alone
- Provides immediate action
- Builds collective power

#### Tool 2: Workplace Organizing
- Map of every workplace
- Anonymous reports of wage theft, safety violations
- Success stories of organizing drives
- Connection to labor organizers

**User flow**:
```
User selects workplace
  → "47 current/former employees have reported issues"
  → "Most common: wage theft (23 reports)"
  → "12 employees are ready to organize"
  → "Connect anonymously via Signal"
  → [Union Comparison Tool] [Know Your Rights] [File Complaint]
```

#### Tool 3: Mutual Aid Network
- Neighborhood-based
- Cryptographic anonymity for safety
- Coordination tool for:
  - Food distribution
  - Eviction defense
  - Medical cost sharing
  - Childcare co-ops

**User flow**:
```
User needs help with rent
  → "Mutual aid fund has $12,000 available"
  → "Request up to $1,500 (average: $800)"
  → "No questions asked, no payback required"
  → "When you can, contribute what you're able"
  → Zero-knowledge proof: request is legitimate, identity protected
```

### Phase 2: Enable Collective Action

**Congressional messages are performative.**

**Rent strikes, workplace organizing, mutual aid—these are real.**

#### Cryptographic Tools for Organizing

**Problem**: Organizing is dangerous. Employers retaliate. Landlords evict. ICE raids.

**Solution**: Zero-knowledge coordination.

##### Anonymous Union Cards
- Workers can sign union cards anonymously
- Threshold signature reveals count without identities
- Once 50%+1 reached, everyone's signatures become public simultaneously
- Can't single out early organizers

##### Protected Tenant Associations
- Tenants can join without landlord knowing
- Encrypted communication via Signal
- Voting on rent strikes uses ZK proofs
- "80% of building voted yes" but landlord can't identify individuals

##### Mutual Aid Coordination
- Request help anonymously
- Fulfill requests anonymously
- Build trust through cryptographic reputation
- No centralized database to raid/subpoena

### Phase 3: Information Warfare

**The billionaire class controls the narrative.**

**We need infrastructure to tell the truth at scale.**

#### Template System (Repurposed)

**Not**: "Tell your rep you care about housing"

**But**:

**Template**: "Expose your landlord's rent-gouging scheme"
```
Subject: [Landlord Name] Raised Rent 40% While Taking $2.3M in Tax Breaks

I'm a tenant at [Address]. Our landlord, [Name], has:
- Raised rent 40% over 3 years
- Received $2.3M in property tax breaks
- Failed to fix [violations] for [months]
- Started eviction proceedings against [number] tenants

This is happening at [number] buildings in [neighborhood].

We're organizing. Join us: [encrypted link]

cc: Local news, housing advocates, elected officials
```

**This template**:
- Names the enemy
- Uses real data (from our landlord database)
- Builds collective power
- Spreads awareness
- Puts pressure on the landlord

#### Viral Truth-Telling

**Every time someone uses the platform**:
- Generate infographic: "My landlord raised rent 40% while getting $2.3M in tax breaks"
- One-click share to Twitter/Instagram/TikTok
- Link to landlord database
- Link to tenant association

**This goes viral because**:
- It's true
- It names the enemy
- It offers solution (organizing)
- It's visual and shareable
- It taps into rage, not civics

---

## Why This Actually Works

### 1. Addresses Material Needs

**Not**: "Feel good about civic participation"
**But**: "Stop your eviction, get rent relief, organize your workplace"

### 2. Names the Enemy

Mamdani won because he said:
- "Billionaire class"
- "Political dynasty"
- "Trump"

We need to say:
- "Your landlord"
- "Your boss"
- "Algorithmic rent-pricing software"
- "Private equity firms"

**People know who's fucking them over.**

Stop pretending the enemy is "low voter turnout" or "political polarization."

The enemy is **people with power extracting wealth from people without power.**

### 3. Builds Real Power

**Civic engagement**: Send message → representative ignores it → nothing changes

**Collective action**:
- Tenant association → rent strike → landlord negotiates → rent stabilizes
- Union drive → collective bargaining → wages increase
- Mutual aid → eviction defense → people keep homes

**Real power is the ability to make someone more powerful than you do something they don't want to do.**

Congressional messages don't do that.

Rent strikes do.

### 4. Creates Community Through Struggle

**Not**: "Join our platform, see your impact dashboard"

**But**: "You and 36 neighbors are fighting the same landlord. Here's the Signal group. Meeting is Thursday."

**Community isn't about social features.**

**Community is forged through collective struggle against a common enemy.**

### 5. Spreads Through Truth

**Gamification is bullshit.**

**What spreads is truth that validates people's lived experience:**

- "I knew my rent was too high"
- "I knew my landlord was a crook"
- "I knew I wasn't alone"
- "I didn't know we could fight back"

**When you give people:**
1. Data that proves what they already felt
2. Tools to act on it
3. Community to act with

**They don't share it because of gamification.**

**They share it because it's the truth and they're fucking angry.**

## The Technical Implementation

### What We Already Have

- ✅ Zero-knowledge proofs (privacy-preserving verification)
- ✅ Encrypted communication (TEE-based)
- ✅ Template system (needs repurposing)
- ✅ Location matching (needs repurposing for tenant/workplace organizing)
- ✅ OAuth (identity, but anonymity when needed)

### What We Need to Build

#### 1. Power Mapping Database

**Landlord/Employer Database**:
- Scrape public records (property ownership, corporate filings)
- Crowdsource data (tenant/worker reports)
- Anonymous submission via ZK proofs
- Reputation system for data quality

**Schema**:
```prisma
model PowerStructure {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  type            String   // "landlord", "employer", "politician"

  // Public info
  legalName       String
  dbaNames        String[] // Doing Business As
  addresses       String[]

  // Ownership
  parentCompanies String[] // Shell companies, private equity
  executives      Json     // Names, roles

  // Impact data
  rentIncreases   Json     // Historical rent data
  evictions       Json     // Eviction records
  violations      Json     // Code violations, labor violations
  taxBreaks       Json     // Public subsidies received

  // Collective action
  tenantReports   Int      @default(0)
  workerReports   Int      @default(0)
  organizing      Json     // Active campaigns

  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([type])
  @@map("power_structure")
}
```

#### 2. Anonymous Organizing Tools

**Threshold Signatures for Union Cards**:
- Workers sign anonymously
- Signatures accumulate in ZK proofs
- Only reveal count, not identities
- At 50%+1, all signatures become public simultaneously

**Encrypted Coordination**:
- Signal integration for group chat
- Vote on actions (strikes, demands) via ZK proofs
- "80% voted yes" without revealing who

#### 3. Mutual Aid Coordination

**Need Matching**:
- Anonymous requests: "Need $800 for rent"
- Anonymous fulfillment: "I can give $100"
- ZK proof: request is legitimate (from verified community member)
- Reputation: contribution history without identity

**Trust Without Identity**:
- Cryptographic reputation (you've helped X times)
- Can't be seized (no centralized database)
- Can't be gamed (ZK proof of real contribution)

#### 4. Truth Amplification

**Data → Narrative → Viral**:
```
User queries landlord database
  → Gets ownership structure, rent increases, violations
  → Generates shareable infographic
  → "My landlord is [name], owns [47 buildings], raised rent [40%], took [$2.3M] in tax breaks"
  → One-click share to social
  → Link back to database + organizing tools
```

## What Success Looks Like

### 6 Months

**User base**:
- 10,000 tenants using landlord database
- 50 active tenant associations coordinating via platform
- 5,000 workers researching employers
- 10 active union drives using ZK signature tools
- $50,000 distributed via mutual aid

**Victories**:
- 3 successful rent strikes (rent decreases)
- 2 union recognition elections won
- 100 evictions stopped
- 500 people kept in their homes via mutual aid

**Visibility**:
- 100,000 Twitter impressions/week (from shared infographics)
- 50 news stories: "Platform helps tenants organize"
- Landlord/employer associations crying to legislators
- Being actively opposed = we're working

### 12 Months

**User base**:
- 100,000 tenants
- 500 active tenant associations
- 50,000 workers
- 100 active union drives
- $500,000 distributed via mutual aid

**Victories**:
- 50 successful rent strikes
- 20 union victories
- 1,000 evictions stopped
- Measurable impact on rent trends in organized neighborhoods

**Systemic impact**:
- Landlords now afraid to raise rent (risk of organization)
- Employers now afraid of wage theft (risk of unionization)
- Politicians forced to respond (organized tenants vote)
- Platform seen as essential infrastructure for organizing

---

## The Real Difference

### Old Strategy (Civic Engagement Theater)
- "Make civic action shareable"
- Gamification, leaderboards, badges
- "You're #42 in your city for congressional messages!"
- Asking nicely for change
- Individual action without power
- **Result**: Feel-good metrics, zero material impact

### New Strategy (Infrastructure for Class Struggle)
- Make power visible
- Enable collective action
- Protect organizers cryptographically
- Build real power through solidarity
- **Result**: Rent decreases, wage increases, people stay in homes

---

## Why This Aligns With Phase 2 (Token Economics)

**Phase 1**: Build organizing infrastructure
- Landlord/employer databases
- Anonymous coordination tools
- Mutual aid networks
- Proven victories

**Phase 2**: Add token layer
- Reputation becomes on-chain
- Mutual aid pools become DAO treasuries
- Organizing victories get rewarded
- Platform becomes self-sustaining

**But Phase 2 only works if Phase 1 delivers real power.**

Can't tokenize impotence.

Can only tokenize victory.

---

## The Brutal Truth

**Most civic tech fails because it's built by people who think the system works.**

They think if we just make it easier to contact representatives, democracy will function.

**The system doesn't work.**

**It's working exactly as designed: to serve the wealthy and well-connected.**

**Mamdani won by saying this explicitly.**

He won by:
- Naming the enemy (billionaire class, political dynasties)
- Promising material improvements (rent freeze, free buses, childcare)
- Building mass movement (100,000 volunteers)
- Direct confrontation with power (Trump, Cuomo)

**We should build the infrastructure that makes more Mamdanis possible.**

Not by asking nicely.

By building power from below.

By making it so landlords are afraid to raise rent because tenants will organize.

By making it so employers are afraid to steal wages because workers will unionize.

By making it so politicians are afraid to ignore us because we have the capacity to make their lives difficult.

## Next Steps (For Real This Time)

### Week 1: Research

**Not**: "Interview users about sharing civic action"

**But**:
1. Interview 20 tenants facing eviction/rent increases
   - What do they need?
   - Do they know who owns their building?
   - Have they tried to organize?
   - What stops them?

2. Interview 10 labor organizers
   - What tools do they use?
   - What's missing?
   - How could crypto help protect workers?

3. Interview 5 mutual aid organizers
   - How do they coordinate?
   - Trust/fraud issues?
   - Could crypto help?

### Week 2-4: MVP

**Landlord Database v1**:
- Scrape NYC property ownership data
- Build search by address
- Show ownership structure, rent trends
- Anonymous tenant reporting

**Test with 100 tenants in one neighborhood**:
- Can they find their landlord?
- Does the data match their experience?
- Do they want to organize?

### Week 5-8: Organizing Tools v1

**Anonymous Tenant Association Formation**:
- Signal group creation
- ZK voting on demands
- Encrypted coordination

**Test with 5 buildings**:
- Can tenants organize without landlord knowing?
- Can they vote on actions?
- Does this lead to real-world organizing?

### Month 3: First Victory

**Goal**: One successful rent strike or tenant victory

**If we can't deliver material improvement in 3 months, pivot.**

**If we can, scale.**

## Conclusion: Build for the Darkness

Mamdani's speech wasn't hopeful because things are good.

It was hopeful because he named the darkness and offered a path through it.

Not through civility.
Not through incremental reform.
Not through asking nicely.

But through:
- Solidarity
- Collective power
- Direct confrontation with those who exploit us
- Material improvement in people's lives

**That's what we should build.**

Not another civic engagement platform.

But infrastructure for class struggle.

With cryptographic guarantees to protect organizers.

And the capacity to deliver real victories.

**Because people don't need more ways to feel good about participating in a broken system.**

**They need tools to break the system and build something better.**

That's what actually works.
