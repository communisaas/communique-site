# Message Delivery Documentation

**How the voter-protocol enables civic impact tracking and coordination.**

---

## Overview

**What users care about**: Did my message have impact? Can I track it?

**What the protocol delivers**:
- Track your civic actions over time
- See coordination with others ("5,000 people contacted Senator Warren about housing")
- Build on-chain reputation for civic participation (ERC-8004)
- Collective power through coordination visibility

**Two ways to participate**:
1. **Join the protocol** (recommended) - Connect OAuth, get impact tracking, reputation, coordination visibility
2. **Send without tracking** - No OAuth, message gets sent but no verification/tracking

**Who you can contact**: ANY decision-maker (Congress, local gov, corporations, HOAs, universities, healthcare, nonprofits)

**User perspective**: "I want to track my civic impact" not "Which delivery method?"

## Core Documentation

### 1. [delivery.md](delivery.md) - Protocol Participation Guide

**Read this first**. Explains the voter-protocol utility and how to participate.

**Key insight**: Users care about **tracking civic impact and coordinating with others**, not backend implementation details.

**Covers**:
- Two ways to participate (join protocol vs send without tracking)
- Protocol utility (impact tracking, reputation, coordination visibility)
- Who you can contact (ANY decision-maker with community impact)
- Technical implementation (zero-knowledge verification, OAuth)
- Privacy guarantees (what we verify, what we don't access)
- Roadmap (protocol expansion, Phase 1-4)

**What's new**: Protocol-first framing. OAuth enables the protocol (impact tracking, reputation, coordination), not just "delivery verification."

**Start here**: [delivery.md](delivery.md)

### 2. [dashboard.md](dashboard.md) - Congressional Office Dashboard

Dashboard for congressional offices to view verified constituent messages.

**What it provides**:
- Message inbox (verified constituents only)
- District verification badges
- Aggregate constituent sentiment
- Issue tracking by volume

**Privacy**: Offices see district verification proof, not plaintext addresses.

**Scope**: US Congress (CWC API messages only)

## How Protocol Participation Works

### When You Join the Protocol (Recommended)

**What you do**: Connect your email via OAuth

**What you get**:
- **Impact tracking**: Dashboard showing all civic actions you've taken
- **Coordination visibility**: "5,000 people in your district contacted Senator Warren this week"
- **Reputation building**: On-chain ERC-8004 reputation for civic participation
- **One-click sending**: We handle delivery, verification, credit

**Technical flow**:
```
1. Connect OAuth (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) - one-time setup
2. Customize message template
3. Click "Send" - we handle everything
4. Zero-knowledge verification:
   - For Congress: Address proof generated, message + proof delivered
   - For others: We verify Sent folder (template was sent, message intact)
5. Reputation updates on-chain, impact tracked in dashboard
```

**Privacy**:
- OAuth is read-only (Sent folder only)
- Zero-knowledge verification (we verify template sent, don't read full content)
- For congressional messages: Address verified via ZK proof (office sees district, not address)
- Revoke access anytime

---

### When You Send Without Tracking

**What you do**: Don't connect OAuth

**What happens**:
- Message gets sent (your email client opens, you send manually)
- No verification, no credit
- Outside the voter-protocol

**Trade-off**:
- No impact tracking
- No reputation building
- No coordination visibility
- Can't see civic action history

---

## Privacy Architecture (Protocol Participation)

**What congressional offices see**:
- ✅ Zero-knowledge proof of district membership
- ✅ Message content
- ✅ Timestamp
- ✅ Template category

**What congressional offices DON'T see**:
- ❌ Plaintext address
- ❌ User's email address (unless user includes it in message)
- ❌ User's identity (unless user includes name in message)

**Privacy guarantees**:
- Address encrypted in browser using witness encryption
- TEE decrypts only during proving (2-5s window)
- Address never persists in TEE memory
- Proof is zero-knowledge (reveals district, not address)
- CWC API receives proof + message, not address

**For direct email privacy**, see `/docs/strategy/delivery-verification.md`

## CWC API Integration Details

**Authentication**:
```env
CWC_API_KEY=... # Set in .env
CWC_API_BASE_URL=https://soapbox.senate.gov/api
```

**Rate limits**:
- 10 submissions per hour per user (prevents spam)
- Tracked in DynamoDB (server-side)
- User sees: "Rate limit reached, try again in X minutes"

**Error handling**:
- Delivery failures → automatic retry (max 3 attempts)
- Invalid address → user prompted to verify
- CWC API down → queue message for later delivery

---

## Deployment Requirements

**Environment variables**:
```env
# CWC API
CWC_API_KEY=... # Required
CWC_API_BASE_URL=... # Optional (defaults to production)

# TEE Configuration
AWS_NITRO_ENCLAVE_ENABLED=true # Production only
TEE_PUBLIC_KEY=... # TEE enclave public key

# Rate Limiting
DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME=... # DynamoDB table for rate limits
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS=3600 # 1 hour window
RATE_LIMIT_COUNT=10 # 10 messages per hour
```

**Infrastructure**:
- AWS Nitro Enclaves (ARM Graviton, hypervisor-isolated)
- DynamoDB (rate limiting state)
- SQS (message queue for retry logic)

---

## Testing

**Integration tests**:
```bash
npm run test:integration -- congressional-delivery.test.ts
```

**What's tested**:
- CWC API submission flow
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Delivery receipt verification
- Error handling and retries
- TEE proof generation (mocked in tests)

**Mocking**:
- CWC API responses mocked
- TEE proving mocked (use deterministic test proofs)
- DynamoDB mocked (in-memory rate limit tracking)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Message delivery failed**:
1. Check CWC API status
2. Verify API key is valid
3. Check rate limits (user may have hit limit)
4. Check TEE enclave health
5. Review error logs in Fly.io

**Proof generation failed**:
1. Check TEE enclave is running
2. Verify address is valid (geocoding succeeded)
3. Check Halo2 proving timeout (should be <10s)
4. Review TEE logs

**Congressional office reports message not received**:
1. Check delivery receipt in database
2. Verify CWC API returned success
3. Check message wasn't spam filtered by office
4. Provide delivery receipt as proof

## For Congressional Staff

**Setting up dashboard access**:
1. Contact Communiqué team for dashboard credentials
2. Navigate to `/congressional/dashboard`
3. View verified constituent messages
4. Filter by issue category, date range
5. Export messages as CSV

**Understanding verification badges**:
- ✅ Green badge: Zero-knowledge district proof verified
- ⏳ Yellow badge: Verification pending
- ❌ Red badge: Verification failed (likely spam)

**Privacy questions**:
- "Can you see constituent addresses?" → No, we store only commitment hashes
- "How do you verify district?" → Zero-knowledge proof (Halo2 circuit)
- "Can constituents fake verification?" → No, proof is cryptographically secure
