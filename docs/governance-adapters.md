# Governance Adapters

**How Communique scales globally: One platform, every government.**

## The Adapter Pattern

Communique is governance-neutral infrastructure. Each government type gets an adapter that translates universal civic actions into system-specific delivery.

```typescript
interface GovernanceAdapter {
  // Identify representatives for a location
  resolveRepresentatives(location: UserLocation): Representative[]
  
  // Format message for delivery system
  formatMessage(template: Template, reps: Representative[]): DeliveryPayload
  
  // Submit through official channels
  submitAction(payload: DeliveryPayload): SubmissionReceipt
  
  // Verify delivery succeeded
  verifyDelivery(receipt: SubmissionReceipt): boolean
}
```

## Current Implementation: US Congress

**CWC Adapter** (`src/lib/congress/`):
- Geocodes address → congressional district
- Looks up House rep + 2 Senators
- Formats for Communicating with Congress API
- Submits with required fields (prefix, topic, delivery)
- Returns cryptographic receipt

## Planned Adapters

### Westminster Parliamentary (UK, Canada, Australia)
```typescript
class WestminsterAdapter implements GovernanceAdapter {
  // Postcode → constituency → MP
  // Format for parliamentary submission system
  // Handle both Commons and Lords where applicable
}
```

### European Parliamentary
```typescript
class EuropeanParliamentAdapter implements GovernanceAdapter {
  // Country + region → MEPs
  // Multi-language template support
  // EU petition system integration
}
```

### Direct Democracy (Switzerland, California)
```typescript
class DirectDemocracyAdapter implements GovernanceAdapter {
  // Initiative/referendum tracking
  // Signature collection and verification
  // Proposal submission workflows
}
```

### Municipal/Local
```typescript
class MunicipalAdapter implements GovernanceAdapter {
  // City council members
  // Local department heads
  // Public comment submission
}
```

## Adapter Requirements

**Must Have:**
- Representative lookup by geography
- Official submission channel (API/email/form)
- Delivery verification method
- Template variable mapping

**Nice to Have:**
- Real-time delivery confirmation
- Response tracking
- Public record integration
- Voting record correlation

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Research Phase**: Document submission requirements, API availability, legal constraints
2. **Prototype**: Build minimal adapter with core flows
3. **Pilot**: Test with small user group in target country
4. **Launch**: Full rollout with VOTER Protocol rewards
5. **Iterate**: Add features based on usage patterns

## Global Scaling Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current)**: US Congress via CWC API
- Proven model with 81M messages/year
- Establishes patterns and infrastructure
- Generates revenue for expansion

**Phase 2 (Q2 2025)**: English-speaking Parliamentary
- UK House of Commons
- Canadian Parliament
- Australian Parliament
- Similar systems, shared language

**Phase 3 (Q3 2025)**: European Expansion
- German Bundestag
- French Assemblée
- European Parliament
- Multi-language templates

**Phase 4 (Q4 2025)**: Emerging Democracies
- India Lok Sabha
- Brazil Congress
- Indonesia DPR
- Massive populations, growing digital adoption

**Phase 5 (2026)**: New Governance Forms
- Digital-first governments (Estonia)
- Blockchain-native governance (DAOs)
- Experimental democratic systems

## Why This Wins

**Universal Interface**: One platform for all civic action globally
**Local Compliance**: Each adapter handles specific requirements
**Network Effects**: Reputation portable across all governments
**Economic Incentive**: VOTER rewards work everywhere
**Viral Growth**: Templates spread across borders

Democracy isn't just American. Communique makes civic participation instant, rewarding, and viral—everywhere.
