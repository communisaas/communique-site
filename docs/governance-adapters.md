# Governance Adapters

**Status**: Phase 1 (US Congress) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED | Phase 2-5 (Global Expansion) üîÆ PLANNED

---

**How Communique scales globally: One platform, every government.**

## The Adapter Pattern

Communique is governance-neutral infrastructure. Each government type gets an adapter that translates universal civic actions into system-specific delivery.

```typescript
interface GovernanceAdapter {
	// Identify representatives for a location
	resolveRepresentatives(location: UserLocation): Representative[];

	// Format message for delivery system
	formatMessage(template: Template, reps: Representative[]): DeliveryPayload;

	// Submit through official channels
	submitAction(payload: DeliveryPayload): SubmissionReceipt;

	// Verify delivery succeeded
	verifyDelivery(receipt: SubmissionReceipt): boolean;
}
```

## Current Implementation: US Congress ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**CWC Adapter** (`src/lib/congress/`):

- Geocodes address ‚Üí congressional district
- Looks up House rep + 2 Senators
- Formats for Communicating with Congress API
- Submits with required fields (prefix, topic, delivery)
- Returns cryptographic receipt

## Planned Adapters üîÆ FUTURE ROADMAP

### Westminster Parliamentary (UK, Canada, Australia)

```typescript
class WestminsterAdapter implements GovernanceAdapter {
	// Postcode ‚Üí constituency ‚Üí MP
	// Format for parliamentary submission system
	// Handle both Commons and Lords where applicable
}
```

### European Parliamentary

```typescript
class EuropeanParliamentAdapter implements GovernanceAdapter {
	// Country + region ‚Üí MEPs
	// Multi-language template support
	// EU petition system integration
}
```

### Direct Democracy (Switzerland, California)

```typescript
class DirectDemocracyAdapter implements GovernanceAdapter {
	// Initiative/referendum tracking
	// Signature collection and verification
	// Proposal submission workflows
}
```

### Municipal/Local

```typescript
class MunicipalAdapter implements GovernanceAdapter {
	// City council members
	// Local department heads
	// Public comment submission
}
```

## Adapter Requirements

**Must Have:**

- Representative lookup by geography
- Official submission channel (API/email/form)
- Delivery verification method
- Template variable mapping

**Nice to Have:**

- Real-time delivery confirmation
- Response tracking
- Public record integration
- Voting record correlation

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Research Phase**: Document submission requirements, API availability, legal constraints
2. **Prototype**: Build minimal adapter with core flows
3. **Pilot**: Test with small user group in target country
4. **Launch**: Full rollout with VOTER Protocol rewards
5. **Iterate**: Add features based on usage patterns

## Global Scaling Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current)** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: US Congress via CWC API

- Proven model with 81M messages/year
- Establishes patterns and infrastructure
- Generates revenue for expansion

**Phase 2 (Q2 2025)** üîÆ PLANNED: English-speaking Parliamentary

- UK House of Commons
- Canadian Parliament
- Australian Parliament
- Similar systems, shared language

**Phase 3 (Q3 2025)** üîÆ PLANNED: European Expansion

- German Bundestag
- French Assembl√©e
- European Parliament
- Multi-language templates

**Phase 4 (Q4 2025)** üîÆ PLANNED: Emerging Democracies

- India Lok Sabha
- Brazil Congress
- Indonesia DPR
- Massive populations, growing digital adoption

**Phase 5 (2026)** üîÆ PLANNED: New Governance Forms

- Digital-first governments (Estonia)
- Blockchain-native governance (DAOs)
- Experimental democratic systems
