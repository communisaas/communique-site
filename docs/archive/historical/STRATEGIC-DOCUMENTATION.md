# Strategic Documentation - Problem/Solution Fit

**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Status**: Active iteration - clearing cruft, finding core truth

---

## The Actual Problem

### ❌ NOT THIS:
> "People can't send verified messages"
> "People don't know their representatives"
> "Messages get lost in the system"

### ✅ THIS:
> **Coordination failure.**
>
> Individual messages get ignored. Coordinated pressure works.
> One person complaining = noise.
> 5,000 people using the same template = signal decision-makers can't ignore.

---

## What We Actually Do

### The Coordination Platform:

1. **Someone writes a template** - Articulates the issue clearly
2. **Template gets shared everywhere** - Discord, Twitter, group chats, protests (QR codes)
3. **People use the template** - Each person sends to their decision-maker
4. **Decision-makers see coordination** - "5,000 constituents used the same message"
5. **Coordination = pressure** - Can't be ignored

### The Key Insight:
**Scattered complaints get filed. Coordinated campaigns get meetings.**

---

## The Real Value Propositions

### For Template Creators:
> "Create a campaign. We'll help you coordinate."

- Write once, used by thousands
- Track impact (5,247 people sent this)
- See geographic spread (active in 47 states)
- Social proof builds momentum

### For Template Users:
> "Join 5,247 others. Make this impossible to ignore."

- Don't write from scratch (use proven template)
- Be part of something bigger (coordination = power)
- See real-time impact (others are acting too)
- FOMO-driven viral spread

### For Decision-Makers:
> "This is coordinated. You can't ignore it."

- 5,000 identical messages = organized constituency
- Geographic spread proves it's not astroturf
- Social proof = "This issue has legs"
- Coordinator is visible (template creator)

---

## What "Verification" Actually Means (And Doesn't)

### ❌ NOT THIS (Wrong Focus):
> "Verified messages" = Crypto buzzword, solves nothing
> "Proof of delivery" = Nice to have, not the core value
> "Zero-knowledge proofs" = Technical flex, users don't care

### ✅ THIS (What Actually Matters):
> **Verified coordination.**
>
> - Public counter: "5,247 people sent this" (social proof)
> - Geographic spread: "Active in 47 states" (proves it's real)
> - Momentum tracking: "+127 in the last hour" (FOMO)
> - Template attribution: "Created by @organizer" (credit flows to coordinator)

---

## The Core Messaging (Fixed)

### Homepage Hero:

**WRONG** (Verification focus):
> Your voice. Their decision.
> Send verified messages to the people who decide.

**RIGHT** (Coordination focus):
> **Your voice. Their decision.**
>
> **Coordinate campaigns that decision-makers can't ignore.**
> One complaint gets filed. 5,000 coordinated messages get meetings.

**Why it works**:
- "Coordinate campaigns" = Clear action (the platform's job)
- "can't ignore" = Outcome users want
- "5,000 coordinated messages" = Social proof + power dynamic
- Contrast (1 vs 5,000) = Makes the problem/solution obvious

---

### Address Collection:

**WRONG** (Verification focus):
> Verify your message
> Prove delivery

**RIGHT** (Routing focus):
> **Find who represents you**
>
> Your address routes your message to the right officials.
> Used once. Deleted immediately.

**Why it works**:
- Explains WHY (routing, not data collection)
- Privacy promise (used once, deleted)
- Clear benefit (find the right person)

---

### Template Card:

**WRONG** (Verification focus):
> ✓ Verified delivery
> ✓ Proof of impact

**RIGHT** (Coordination focus):
> **5,247 people sent this**
> Active in 47 states
> +127 in the last hour

**Why it works**:
- Social proof (5,247 people)
- Geographic validation (47 states = not astroturf)
- Momentum (FOMO-driven urgency)

---

## The Viral Mechanics (What Actually Spreads)

### ❌ NOT THIS (Tech Features):
> "Zero-knowledge proofs"
> "Blockchain reputation"
> "Verified delivery"

### ✅ THIS (Social Proof + FOMO):
> "5,247 people already sent this. Join them."
>
> **Why it spreads**:
> 1. **Social proof** - "5,247 people can't be wrong"
> 2. **FOMO** - "+127 in the last hour" (happening NOW)
> 3. **Easy action** - Pre-written template (low friction)
> 4. **Collective power** - "5,000 coordinated messages get meetings"
> 5. **Geographic spread** - "47 states" (proves it's real, not bot-driven)

---

## The Platform's Job

### NOT THIS:
- Verify individual messages
- Prove delivery
- Track individual actions
- Store user data

### THIS:
1. **Enable template creation** - Anyone can start a campaign
2. **Facilitate viral spread** - Share everywhere (Discord, Twitter, QR codes)
3. **Show coordination** - Public counters, geographic spread, momentum
4. **Route to decision-makers** - Right person gets the message (address → reps)
5. **Protect privacy** - Zero data retention (address used once, deleted)

---

## The Copy Framework (Coordination-First)

### Universal Structure:

**Problem** (Individual action fails):
> One complaint gets filed.

**Solution** (Coordination works):
> 5,000 coordinated messages get meetings.

**How** (The platform enables coordination):
> Create campaigns. Share everywhere. Track impact.

**Outcome** (Decision-makers can't ignore):
> Make this impossible to ignore.

---

## Strategic Messaging Map

### Discovery Phase (Homepage):

**Hero**:
> Your voice. Their decision.
> **Coordinate campaigns that decision-makers can't ignore.**
> One complaint gets filed. 5,000 coordinated messages get meetings.

**Examples** (Show range):
> Congress. Companies. School boards. Anyone with power.

**Social Proof**:
> 12,847 people coordinating across 2,134 campaigns.

---

### Engagement Phase (Template Page):

**Template Header**:
> **[Template Title]**
> 5,247 people sent this · Active in 47 states · +127 in the last hour

**Social Proof Callout**:
> Join 5,247 others. Make this impossible to ignore.

**CTA**:
> [Send Now] or [Share This Campaign]

---

### Conversion Phase (Address/Verification):

**Address Collection** (When needed):
> Find who represents you
> Your address routes your message to the right officials.
> Used once. Deleted immediately.

**No Address Needed** (Companies, etc.):
> Send your message
> Join 5,247 others making [Company] listen.

---

### Celebration Phase (Post-Send):

**Individual Confirmation**:
> ✓ Message sent

**Collective Impact**:
> You + 5,247 others made this issue impossible to ignore.
>
> This campaign is active in 47 states.
> +127 people sent in the last hour.

**Share CTA**:
> **Make this louder**
> [Share this campaign]

## What Gets Removed (Cruft)

### 1. "Verified messages" language ❌
- Solves wrong problem
- Crypto buzzword
- Users don't care

### 2. Over-explanation of crypto ❌
- Zero-knowledge proofs (technical flex)
- Witness encryption (users don't care)
- TEE processing (irrelevant to value prop)

### 3. Individual action framing ❌
- "Your voice matters" (weak)
- "Make a difference" (vague)
- "Be heard" (passive)

### 4. Privacy-defensive tone ❌
- "but never stored" (defensive)
- "We protect your privacy" (everyone says this)
- Over-explaining what we DON'T do

---

## What Stays (Core Truth)

### 1. Coordination language ✅
- "5,247 people sent this"
- "Active in 47 states"
- "+127 in the last hour"
- "Join others. Make this impossible to ignore."

### 2. Routing logic ✅
- "Your address routes your message"
- "Find who represents you"
- Clear WHY (constituent verification)

### 3. Privacy promise (brief) ✅
- "Used once. Deleted immediately."
- Progressive disclosure for curious users

### 4. Outcome-focused ✅
- "Get meetings" (not "be heard")
- "Can't ignore" (not "might listen")
- "Coordinated pressure works" (not "your voice matters")

---

## The Strategic Pivot

### FROM (Verification Platform):
> Send verified messages to decision-makers.
> Prove delivery. Track impact. Zero-knowledge privacy.

### TO (Coordination Platform):
> Coordinate campaigns that decision-makers can't ignore.
> One complaint gets filed. 5,000 coordinated messages get meetings.

**Why this works**:
- **Clear problem** - Individual action fails
- **Clear solution** - Coordination works
- **Clear mechanism** - Templates + viral spread + social proof
- **Clear outcome** - Can't be ignored

---

## Documentation Strategy (Next)

### Phase 1: Consolidate (This Week)
1. **Archive old docs** - Move to `/docs/archive/`
2. **Create master doc** - `COORDINATION-PLATFORM.md` (single source of truth)
3. **Kill cruft** - Remove "verified messages", crypto over-explanation
4. **Fix messaging** - Coordination-first everywhere

### Phase 2: Implement (Next Week)
1. **Update all copy** - Homepage, templates, modals
2. **Remove verification language** - Replace with coordination language
3. **Add social proof everywhere** - Counters, geographic spread, momentum
4. **Test messaging** - A/B test old vs new

### Phase 3: Measure (Ongoing)
1. **Track viral coefficient** - k > 1.0 = sustainable growth
2. **Monitor social proof impact** - Do counters increase conversion?
3. **Measure coordination** - Are templates being used 100+ times?
4. **Decision-maker responses** - Do coordinated campaigns get meetings?

---

## The Bottom Line

**What we were saying** (WRONG):
> Send verified messages to decision-makers.

**What we should say** (RIGHT):
> Coordinate campaigns that decision-makers can't ignore.

**Why this matters**:
- **Verification** = Solving wrong problem (crypto flex, users don't care)
- **Coordination** = Solving real problem (individual action fails, collective action works)

**Core truth**:
> Scattered complaints get filed. Coordinated campaigns get meetings.

**Next**: Update all copy to coordination-first messaging.
