# Phase 2 Implementation Archive (November 2025)

**Status**: Historical - Superseded by current implementation
**Created**: 2025-11-16 (consolidated from root-level status files)

## What's Here

Historical implementation status files from Phase 2 development work:

- **PHASE-2-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md** - Final summary of Phase 2 completion
- **PHASE-2-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md** - Status tracking during implementation
- **PHASE-2-PROOF-GENERATION-UX-SPEC.md** - Original UX spec for proof generation
- **COMMUNIQUE-ZK-IMPLEMENTATION-SPEC.md** - ZK proof integration spec
- **LOCATION-UX-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md** - Location system completion notes
- **PROGRESSIVE-FUNNEL-IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Progressive funnel implementation details

## Current Documentation

For **current** implementation status, see:
- `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` - Single source of truth for what's done/what remains
- `/docs/specs/zk-proof-integration.md` - ZK proof integration guide (45K comprehensive)
- `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Current architecture (Communiqué/voter-protocol separation)

## Why Archived

These files served as progress tracking during active Phase 2 development but are now superseded by:
1. **IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md** - Centralized status tracking (replaces multiple Phase 2 status files)
2. **specs/zk-proof-integration.md** - Comprehensive ZK proof guide (replaces partial implementation specs)
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Current architecture decisions (replaces historical design docs)

**Retained for historical context only.**
