# What People Are Actually Organizing Around (January 2025)

**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Method**: Open-ended web research without predetermined categories
**Purpose**: Let the patterns emerge from what's actually working, not what we think should work

---

## The Search Process

Instead of searching for predetermined power structures (landlords, employers, HOAs), I searched for:
- "organizing victories january 2025"
- "people won against corporations institutions organizing"
- "what are people organizing around what's working"
- "grassroots campaigns material wins concrete improvements"

**Key insight**: When you let the data speak instead of imposing categories, different patterns emerge.

## What's Actually Winning Right Now

### 1. Tenant Organizing (MASSIVE MOMENTUM)

**Kansas City Independence Towers (June 2025)**:
- **247-day rent strike** - longest in KC history
- **Won**: Rent caps (studios $730, 1-beds $855, 2-beds $965)
- **Won**: Comprehensive pest extermination, HVAC repairs by Nov 2025
- **Won**: Formal recognition of tenant union (will renegotiate next year)
- **Won**: Zero back-rent owed, no retaliation clause
- **Tactic**: Collective withholding, union formation, formal contract

**Brooklyn 1616 President St. (January 2025)**:
- **Four-year rent strike**
- **Won**: $250,000 in waived rent
- **Won**: Judge-ordered repairs
- **Tactic**: Long-term collective action, legal system engagement

**Toronto (March 2025)**:
- **Corporate landlord rent strike**
- **Won**: Lower rents
- **Won**: Compensation for neglected repairs
- **Won**: Official recognition of tenant union
- **Tactic**: Organizing against financialized housing

**Pattern**: Rent strikes with formal union recognition are winning. Not just individual tenant rights, but **collective power institutionalized through union contracts**.

---

### 2. Workplace Organizing (UNION WAVE CONTINUES)

**Indiana University Graduate Workers (January 2025)**:
- **Won**: 4% raise ($1,000/year) for all graduate workers
- **Tactic**: Two strikes (2022, 2024 "Three Days For A Raise"), marches, protests, petitions

**Amazon & Starbucks (2023-2025 ongoing)**:
- **Amazon Staten Island**: First warehouse unionized
- **Starbucks**: Over 100 locations unionized following Buffalo win
- **Tactic**: Strategic organizing, NLRB petitions

**General Labor Trends**:
- **Workers voted 74% in favor of unions** (through April 2024, up from 69% in 2019)
- **Union petitions doubled during Biden years** (3,286 petitions FY2024, up 27% from 2023)
- **Union membership up 500,000** over last two years
- **Public support at 60-year high**

**Major Strike Wins (2024)**:
- **Boeing Machinists**: 38% wage increase over 4 years
- **Longshoremen (ILA)**: 62% pay increase over 6 years (3-day strike)
- **Southwest flight attendants (TWU)**: 22.3% raise by May 2025

**New Union Sectors**:
- **First unionized strippers** (Star Garden Topless Dive Bar, Hollywood - 17-0 vote)
- **First Trader Joe's, Apple stores, Chipotle** locations unionized
- **Farm workers**: 500 workers at 5 NY farms unionized

**Pattern**: Strikes work. Short, strategic strikes (3 days for longshoremen) can win 62% raises. Sectors previously thought "unorganizable" are organizing (strippers, retail, tech contractors).

---

### 3. Ballot Initiatives (DIRECT DEMOCRACY WORKS)

**Missouri Prop A (November 2024)**:
- **Won**: $15/hour minimum wage
- **Won**: 7 days paid sick leave annually
- **Impact**: 500,000+ Missouri workers affected

**Alaska Minimum Wage Increase (November 2024)**:
- **Won**: Higher minimum wage
- **Won**: Paid sick leave

**Nebraska Paid Sick Leave (November 2024)**:
- **Won**: Statewide paid sick leave requirement

**Pattern**: When workers can't win through legislatures, they bypass them with ballot initiatives. Winning on material needs: wages, sick leave, basic protections.

---

### 4. Environmental/Indigenous Organizing (LONG-TERM VICTORIES)

**BlueTriton Water Bottling Ontario (2025)**:
- **Grassroots campaign against water commodification**
- **Won**: BlueTriton announced cessation of all private water bottling in Ontario by Jan 2025
- **Tactic**: Multi-year sustained pressure

**Brazil Indigenous Land Rights (September 2024)**:
- **Mundurukú people + Amazon Watch**
- **Won**: Minister of Justice officially "declared" Sawré Muybu (final stage of demarcation)
- **Tactic**: Decade-long coordinated grassroots organizing, strategic advocacy, solidarity

**Swiss Climate Litigation (Klimaseniorinnen case)**:
- **Won**: Swiss government's failure to reduce emissions = violation of citizens' rights
- **Impact**: Landmark precedent for future climate litigation
- **Tactic**: Legal strategy combined with citizen organizing

**Pattern**: Environmental/climate organizing takes YEARS but wins structural victories. Not just policy changes, but legal precedents and permanent land protections.

---

### 5. Migrant Rights (DECADES-LONG FIGHT PAYS OFF)

**Canadian Migrant Caregivers (2024)**:
- **Organizing since 1979** (45 years)
- **Won**: New program granting permanent resident status on arrival
- **Pattern**: Persistence over decades. Multi-generational organizing.

---

### 6. Municipal Housing Policy (LOCAL WINS)

**Hamilton, Ontario**:
- **Won**: Province's first by-law preventing renovictions
- **Tactic**: Grassroots municipal organizing

**Pattern**: When federal/state governments won't act, municipal organizing can create local protections.

---

## What's NOT Showing Up (Conspicuous Absences)

**Missing from "what's working" searches**:
- Civic engagement platforms (Democracy.io, Resistbot, etc.)
- Congressional message campaigns
- Petition platforms (Change.org victories are mostly symbolic)
- Social media slacktivism
- Individual consumer boycotts (except when coordinated by unions)
- Voting alone (without organizing)

**Why**: These don't deliver **material improvements**. They might raise awareness, but they don't change rent, wages, or living conditions.

---

## Common Success Patterns Across All Organizing

### Pattern 1: Collective Action > Individual Action
- **Rent strikes work** because whole buildings withhold together
- **Strikes work** because workers walk out together
- **Ballot initiatives work** because organizers collect signatures + turn out voters together
- Individual complaints, individual lawsuits, individual letters = minimal impact

### Pattern 2: Formal Recognition of Collective Power
- **KC tenants won union recognition** (landlord must negotiate with union)
- **Starbucks/Amazon workers won union certification** (employer must bargain)
- **Indigenous groups won land demarcation** (government formally recognizes sovereignty)
- Informal organizing → formal institutional power

### Pattern 3: Material Wins, Not Symbolic Wins
- **Rent caps** (specific dollar amounts)
- **Wage increases** (specific percentages)
- **Paid sick leave** (specific number of days)
- **Land protection** (specific territories)
- Not: "awareness raised", "petition signed", "message sent"

### Pattern 4: Long Timelines Are Normal
- **KC rent strike**: 247 days
- **Brooklyn rent strike**: 4 years
- **Mundurukú land rights**: 10+ years
- **Canadian migrant workers**: 45 years
- Quick wins are rare; persistence is essential

### Pattern 5: Multiple Tactics Simultaneously
- **KC tenants**: Rent withholding + union formation + legal strategy + media
- **Indiana grad workers**: Strikes + marches + protests + petitions
- **Swiss climate**: Litigation + citizen organizing + international solidarity
- No single tactic wins alone

### Pattern 6: Existing Infrastructure Helps
- **Labor unions** (AFL-CIO, UAW, TWU, etc.) provide resources, legal support, strike funds
- **Tenant unions** formalize collective action
- **Environmental groups** (Amazon Watch) provide decade-long campaign coordination
- Spontaneous organizing is hard; institutional support accelerates wins

## What People Are Organizing Around (Themes)

### Theme 1: HOUSING (Financialization Fight)
- **Against**: Private equity landlords, corporate ownership, rent-gouging, evictions
- **For**: Rent control, repairs, tenant union recognition, social housing
- **Why it's working**: Everyone needs housing, exploitation is obvious, collective action is possible

### Theme 2: WAGES & WORKING CONDITIONS
- **Against**: Poverty wages, no sick leave, unsafe conditions, union-busting
- **For**: Living wages, paid leave, safety protections, union recognition
- **Why it's working**: Workers are concentrated (can strike together), public support is high

### Theme 3: CLIMATE & LAND
- **Against**: Fossil fuel extraction, water privatization, land theft, environmental destruction
- **For**: Emissions reduction, water as commons, Indigenous sovereignty, legal precedents
- **Why it's working**: Long-term organizing builds power over time, legal strategies create precedents

### Theme 4: DEMOCRACY & DECISION-MAKING
- **Against**: Unrepresentative legislatures, corporate capture, no worker/community voice
- **For**: Ballot initiatives, participatory budgeting, union democracy, land-back
- **Why it's working**: People bypass broken systems, create direct democracy

---

## What People Feel Powerless Against (From Research)

### Institutions That Generate Powerlessness:

**Political Institutions**:
- Lack of influence in decision-making
- Obstacles to meaningful participation
- Corporate capture of legislatures/courts
- "No other power center comes remotely close to corporate institutions' ability to dictate what happens in legislatures, bureaucracies, and courts"

**Workplace Institutions**:
- Irregular schedules (can't plan life)
- Rigid structures, bureaucratic hurdles
- No autonomy, no decision-making power
- Controlling management

**Healthcare Institutions**:
- Medical billing exploitation (errors, overcharges)
- Insurance denials (22% Medicare Advantage vs 13% traditional Medicare report care delays)
- Lack of hospital services
- "Institutional environments reward cooperative, compliant, passive behaviors, actively contributing to powerlessness"

**Financial Institutions**:
- Inadequate income, overwhelming debt
- Lack of control over financial situation
- Can't meet basic needs

**Social/Relationship Institutions**:
- Discrimination, prejudice, social isolation
- Controlling spouses
- Marginalization, being ignored

**Moral Distress**:
- "Powerlessness is at the heart of moral distress: we must seriously compromise ourselves or something we hold dear due to external forces seemingly beyond our control"
- News/politics: feeling overwhelmed, frightened, powerless watching "the other side wreak existential harm"

---

## The Powerlessness Paradox

**Paradox**: When people feel powerful, they oppose status quo. When powerless, they support systems that disadvantage them.

**Implication for organizing**: First step is making people feel powerful enough to resist. Small wins build confidence for bigger fights.

## Community Power Building Framework (What Actually Works)

From research on successful community organizing:

### Five Core Activities (Lead Local Framework):
1. **Catalyze** (set agenda): Bring attention to issues, build momentum
2. **Create** (achieve agenda): Develop policies, legislation
3. **Sustain** (govern agenda): Develop leaders, build mutual accountability

### Five Key Leadership Practices (Marshall Ganz):
1. **Public Narrative**: Storytelling (not data alone)
2. **Relationships**: Building trust through listening, motivating
3. **Structure**: Building effective teams
4. **Action**: Mobilizing communities
5. **Strategy**: [Implicit in the framework]

### What Community Power-Building Organizations Do:
- Build and organize a base of **affected people** (not allies, not sympathizers - people directly impacted)
- Take **collective action** (not individual appeals)
- Transform **material conditions** (not just awareness or culture)
- Use advocacy + other tactics (not advocacy alone)

### Important: Non-Linear Process
- "Building community power is not linear"
- "Funders should not expect direct attribution between funding and specific outcomes"
- "Collective capacity often pays dividends over the long term"

**Translation**: This work takes years. Quick metrics (petition signatures, social shares) don't predict success. Long-term relationship building + infrastructure does.

## Alternative Democratic Governance Models (What's Emerging)

### 1. Liquid Democracy
- Hybrid: direct + representative
- Voting rights delegation to trusted entities
- Companies using this to poll employee expertise

### 2. Citizens' Assemblies
- Randomly selected, demographically diverse
- Localities using these for local issues
- More representative than elected bodies

### 3. Deliberative Democracy
- Superior outcomes: less partisanship, more evidence-based reasoning, greater commitment to decisions
- Requires time, facilitation, resources

### 4. Participatory Democracy
- Bottom-up, participatory processes
- Community problem-solving, collaborative governance
- Local level experimentation

### 5. Participatory Budgeting
- **11,500+ processes globally** (up from 1,500 in 2014)
- **Cambridge**: 11th year, $1M budget, 1,300 community ideas
- **NYC**: 24 Council Members, $24M capital funding
- **Viña del Mar (Chile)**: First PB in 2024, $200M CLP for wildfire-affected areas
- Increases accountability, transparency, public engagement, empowerment of marginalized populations

### 6. Environmental Democracy
- Transparency, participation, accountability
- Ensures climate policies reflect community needs

**Pattern**: When people get actual decision-making power (not just consultation), outcomes improve. But these are still experiments, not widespread practice.

## What This Means for Communiqué

### We Were Right About:
1. **Cryptographic organizing tools** - Tenant unions, worker organizing need anonymity protection
2. **Material improvements matter** - Rent strikes win rent caps, strikes win wage increases
3. **Collective action > individual action** - All victories are collective
4. **Long-term infrastructure** - Organizing takes months/years, not days/weeks

### We Were Wrong About (Or Too Narrow):
1. **Not just landlords** - Also: employers, corporate landlords, private equity, governments, healthcare, finance
2. **Not just Congress** - Ballot initiatives, municipal policy, union contracts, legal precedents
3. **Not just "civic engagement"** - Labor organizing, environmental justice, Indigenous sovereignty, migrant rights

### What's Missing from Organizing Infrastructure:

**Tenant Organizing**:
- Database of corporate landlord ownership (who owns which buildings?)
- Anonymous tenant association formation (can't organize if landlord knows who you are)
- Rent strike coordination (how do 40 tenants verify everyone's withholding?)
- Legal support matching (which tenants rights lawyers have won similar cases?)

**Workplace Organizing**:
- Anonymous union card signing (threshold signatures - reveal only when 50%+1 reached)
- Corporate ownership mapping (who really owns this franchise?)
- Workplace violation crowdsourcing (OSHA complaints, wage theft reports)
- Cross-workplace solidarity (organizing multiple locations of same employer)

**Ballot Initiative Organizing**:
- Signature collection coordination (who's collecting where?)
- Volunteer matching (door-knockers, phone-bankers)
- Voter turnout tracking (who needs rides to polls?)

**General Organizing Infrastructure**:
- Mutual aid coordination (who needs help, who can give, how to match anonymously?)
- Long-term relationship tracking (organizing happens over years, not weeks)
- Victory documentation (what tactics actually worked?)
- Legal risk assessment (what's safe to organize around in which jurisdictions?)

---

## Revised Strategy: Build for What's Actually Working

### Phase 1: Tenant Organizing Infrastructure (3 months)
**Why**: Rent strikes are winning right now. KC, Brooklyn, Toronto all won material improvements.

**Build**:
1. **Corporate landlord database** (scrape property ownership, map corporate structures)
2. **Anonymous tenant association formation** (ZK proofs for building verification, encrypted Signal coordination)
3. **Rent strike tools** (collective withholding coordination, legal support matching)
4. **Victory documentation** (KC model: what they demanded, what they won, timeline)

**Success metric**: 5 buildings form tenant associations using our tools, 1 successful negotiation with landlord

---

### Phase 2: Workplace Organizing Tools (3-6 months)
**Why**: Union organizing is surging (74% win rate, petitions doubled). Anonymous card signing is the missing infrastructure.

**Build**:
1. **Threshold signature union cards** (workers sign anonymously, signatures revealed only at 50%+1)
2. **Corporate ownership mapping** (who owns this franchise/contractor company?)
3. **Workplace violation crowdsourcing** (anonymous OSHA/wage theft reports with ZK proof of employment)
4. **Cross-location coordination** (Starbucks model: 100 locations organizing, how do they share tactics?)

**Success metric**: 3 workplaces use threshold signatures for union drives, 1 wins NLRB election

---

### Phase 3: Ballot Initiative Infrastructure (6-12 months)
**Why**: Missouri, Alaska, Nebraska just won minimum wage + paid sick leave. Direct democracy works when organizing happens.

**Build**:
1. **Signature collection coordination** (who's collecting where, how many signatures collected)
2. **Volunteer matching** (match door-knockers to canvassing routes)
3. **Voter turnout tools** (identify supporters, coordinate rides to polls)
4. **Template library** (successful ballot initiative language from MO/AK/NE)

**Success metric**: 1 ballot initiative uses our tools, wins election

---

### Phase 4: General Organizing Commons (12+ months)
**Why**: All organizing needs long-term relationship infrastructure, mutual aid, legal support.

**Build**:
1. **Mutual aid coordination** (anonymous matching, cryptographic reputation, no central database)
2. **Long-term relationship tracking** (organizing relationships last years, need CRM built for organizers)
3. **Legal support network** (tenant lawyers, labor lawyers, immigration lawyers - match to campaigns)
4. **Participatory budgeting tools** (communities want to control how money is spent)

**Success metric**: Platform becomes infrastructure for 100+ organizing campaigns across housing, labor, climate, democracy

---

## Key Insights for Technical Implementation

### 1. Anonymity Is Not Optional
- **Tenant organizing**: Landlords retaliate (eviction threats, rent increases, harassment)
- **Workplace organizing**: Employers fire organizers (illegal but happens constantly)
- **Immigrant organizing**: ICE raids, deportation
- **Our ZK proofs + TEE infrastructure solves this**: Prove "I'm a tenant in this building" without revealing which unit

### 2. Trust Without Identity Is The Hard Problem
- **Tenant organizing**: How do 40 tenants verify everyone's withholding rent?
- **Union organizing**: How do workers know 30 cards are signed without revealing who signed?
- **Mutual aid**: How do you prevent fraud without revealing requester identity?
- **Our cryptographic reputation solves this**: ZK proofs of participation, threshold signatures for collective decisions

### 3. Long-Term Infrastructure, Not Viral Moments
- **KC rent strike**: 247 days
- **Brooklyn rent strike**: 4 years
- **Mundurukú land rights**: 10 years
- **We can't build for viral moments**: Need CRM for organizing, relationship tracking over years, victory documentation

### 4. Material Wins Create Viral Moments
- **KC tenants won rent caps**: This goes viral because it's real
- **Missouri won $15/hour**: This goes viral because 500K workers get raises
- **Starbucks union wins**: This goes viral because workers got power
- **We don't need gamification**: We need infrastructure for real victories, which create their own virality

### 5. Organizing Is Local, Infrastructure Is Global
- **Tenants organize building-by-building**, but need database of all corporate landlords
- **Workers organize workplace-by-workplace**, but need threshold signatures that work everywhere
- **Communities organize city-by-city**, but need template library of successful ballot initiatives
- **We build global infrastructure for local organizing**: Database schemas, crypto primitives, UX patterns that work everywhere

## Next Research Questions

### 1. What organizing is happening that we DON'T see?
- Searches for "organizing victories" show successful campaigns
- But what about **failed campaigns**? (Selection bias)
- What about **ongoing campaigns** that haven't won yet?
- What about **organizing that's too risky to publicize**? (undocumented workers, prisoners, etc.)

### 2. Where are the organizing deserts?
- We see tenant organizing in KC, Brooklyn, Toronto
- We see labor organizing at Amazon, Starbucks, universities
- Where is organizing NOT happening but should be?
- What barriers prevent organizing in those spaces?

### 3. What role does technology currently play?
- How do current organizing campaigns coordinate? (Signal, WhatsApp, email lists?)
- What tools exist? (Action Network, Mobilize, etc.)
- What's missing from existing tools?
- Where would cryptography actually help vs. over-engineering?

### 4. What are the legal risks per organizing type?
- Tenant organizing: eviction retaliation (illegal but happens)
- Labor organizing: firing (illegal but happens), NLRB process
- Ballot initiatives: signature fraud laws, campaign finance laws
- Immigrant organizing: ICE raids, deportation
- Prison organizing: retaliation, loss of privileges, solitary confinement
- Need lawyer consultation before building infrastructure

### 5. Who are the existing organizing networks we should partner with?
- **Tenant unions**: KC Tenants, Met Council on Housing (NYC), ACORN
- **Labor organizing**: AFL-CIO, DSA, Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee
- **Ballot initiatives**: Fairness Project, Ballot Initiative Strategy Center
- **Immigrant rights**: United We Dream, Cosecha Movement
- **Climate/Indigenous**: Amazon Watch, Indigenous Environmental Network
- Don't build in isolation - build with/for actual organizers

---

## Conclusion: Let Reality Guide Strategy

**What we learned**:
- Organizing is happening across housing, labor, climate, democracy, immigrant rights
- Material wins (rent caps, wage increases, land protection, paid sick leave) are what's working
- Collective action (strikes, rent strikes, ballot initiatives) beats individual action (petitions, letters)
- Long timelines (months to decades) are normal
- Formal recognition of collective power (union contracts, land demarcation) is the goal
- Multiple tactics simultaneously (strike + media + legal + political) are necessary
- Existing infrastructure (unions, environmental groups, legal nonprofits) accelerates wins

**What this means for Communiqué**:
1. **Build for organizers, not individuals**: Tenant associations, union drives, ballot initiative campaigns (not "send a message to your rep")
2. **Build for material wins, not symbolic actions**: Rent strike coordination, threshold signature union cards, ballot initiative tools
3. **Build for long timelines, not viral moments**: Relationship tracking over years, victory documentation, persistent infrastructure
4. **Build cryptography for real problems**: Anonymity (protect from retaliation), trust without identity (verify collective action), coordination at scale (100 Starbucks locations organizing)
5. **Build with existing organizers, not in isolation**: Partner with KC Tenants, AFL-CIO, Fairness Project, etc.

**The strategy writes itself when you look at what's actually working.**

We don't need to invent new tactics. We need to build infrastructure that makes existing tactics safer, easier, and more scalable.

Rent strikes work. Union drives work. Ballot initiatives work. Mutual aid works.

Our job: **Make them work better with cryptography.**
