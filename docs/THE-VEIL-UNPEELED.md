# The Veil Unpeeled: Why Organizing Fails and What Stops People

**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Context**: Research into what prevents organizing, why movements collapse, and what people actually fear
**Purpose**: Understand the dark reality behind "what's working" - the failures, the fear, the repression

## The Uncomfortable Truth

In `WHAT-PEOPLE-ARE-ACTUALLY-ORGANIZING-AROUND.md`, I documented victories:
- KC tenants won after 247 days
- Brooklyn tenants won after 4 years
- Union organizing has 74% win rate
- Ballot initiatives are winning minimum wage fights

**But this is survivorship bias.**

For every KC tenant victory, how many rent strikes failed?
For every unionized Starbucks, how many organizing drives were crushed?
For every successful ballot initiative, how many never got enough signatures?

**The veil**: We only see what wins. We don't see what's crushed, what's prevented, what never even starts.

## Why People Don't Organize (The Free Rider Problem)

### The Classic Collective Action Problem

**When multiple people work on a task that benefits all of them, each faces an incentive to shirk**—to work less hard and wait for others to pick up the slack. If the group succeeds even when an individual member shirks, that member gets all the benefit for none of the cost (becoming a "free rider").

**Four grounds for non-participation**:
1. **Lack of sympathy** for the movement
2. **Not being the target** of a mobilization attempt
3. **Not being motivated**
4. **The presence of barriers**

**Group size effects**: Cooperation generally declines when group size increases. In larger groups people often feel less responsible for the common good and believe that their contribution does not matter.

**Social environment influence**: The majority of respondents adopt the norms of their environment. The vast majority of those who did not participate are from milieus that approve of their non-participation.

**Translation**: Even when people WANT organizing to succeed, they have rational incentives not to participate. "Let someone else do it. If it works, I'll benefit anyway."

## Why Organizing Fails (Even When People Try)

### Lack of Leadership and Direction

**Grassroots movements without clear leadership often lack direction**, leaving people aware of issues but uncertain about what action to take to bring tangible change. The absence of centralized management can lead to disinformation, low retention, and disunity among supporters.

### The Horizontalism Trap

**Horizontal leaderless organizations struggle to coordinate necessary action and control protests**, while only disciplined, hierarchical organizations can turn protests on and off as a result of policy negotiations.

**Organized right-wing forces comfortable with hierarchy were able to seize power**, while left-wing movements consumed by horizontalist ideology were unwilling to take power even when offered.

**Translation**: The left's fear of hierarchy makes it impossible to coordinate at scale. The right has no such compunctions.

### Lack of Personal Engagement

**Grassroots organizing fails when organizers don't engage with prospects one-to-one** to educate them about the cause, as confused people will drop out and not participate.

**Translation**: Organizing is labor-intensive, relationship-based work. Viral moments don't sustain movements. Long conversations do.

### Organizational Collapse from External Shocks

**External shocks cause organizational collapse by over-stressing particular points** in the organization's system. When people don't understand why change is necessary, anxiety, cynicism and resistance build.

**Translation**: One crisis (police crackdown, leader arrested, funding cut) can destroy months of organizing.

## What Actually Stops People: Fear of Retaliation

### Workplace Organizing: You Will Be Fired

**Most American workers want a union in their workplace but very few have it**, because the right to organize has been effectively cancelled out by a combination of legal and illegal employer intimidation tactics.

**Workers' fear of retaliation from management led them to be wary of being seen meeting with union organizers**—even away from company property.

**Employers are charged with violating federal law in 41.5% of all union election campaigns**, and one out of five union election campaigns involves a charge that a worker was illegally fired for union activity.

**Common union-busting tactics**:
- **Hire outside consultants** to run anti-union campaigns (3 out of 4 campaigns)
- **Hold mandatory "captive audience" meetings** (9 out of 10 campaigns)
- **Fire organizers** (1 in 5 campaigns)
- **Demote, reduce salary, discipline, reassign shifts** (workplace retaliation)
- **Reward anti-union workers, punish pro-union workers**

**Why workers don't report retaliation**:
- **54% of employees said they wouldn't report misconduct because "I fear retaliation"** (the #1 reason)
- While protected from retaliation under the law in theory, **in practice their fear of retaliation and the potential impact it could have on their jobs and careers keep many from stepping forward**

**Translation**: Union organizing is federally protected. Employers break the law constantly. Workers know they'll be fired. The law doesn't protect them in practice.

### Tenant Organizing: You Will Be Evicted

**Retaliatory eviction is an eviction by a landlord that is motivated by the tenant's exercise of a legal right**, such as complaining to the health department, using a tenant remedy such as rent withholding, or organizing tenants in response to rental conditions.

**Common retaliatory actions by landlords**:
- **Terminate month-to-month tenancy or refuse to renew lease**
- **Decrease services**: Lock laundry room, drain pool, remove cable access, cancel security service
- **Increase rent**
- **Evict for trumped-up reasons** (noise complaints, lease violations, "damage")

**How landlords disguise retaliation**:
- **Unexplained termination that follows shortly after a tenant's legitimate decision to withhold rent**
- **Refusal to renegotiate a lease following a tenant's complaint to the health department**
- **Sending a termination notice alleging misuse of common facilities after a tenant has used the common room to bring tenants together to fight a proposed rent increase**

**Legal protections**:
- **Landlord retaliation is illegal in most states**—but landlords do it anyway
- **California applies presumption of retaliation if eviction occurs within 180 days** of exercising rights
- **In practice**: Landlords evict, tenant has to go to court to prove retaliation, meanwhile they're homeless

**Translation**: Tenant organizing is legally protected. Landlords evict anyway. Courts take months. Tenants can't wait months without housing.

### Immigrant Organizing: You Will Be Deported

**From February through May 2025, ICE detained an average of about 20,000 immigrants each month**, a more than threefold increase from 2024, with Trump's efforts to rapidly increase apprehensions and raids going beyond precedent set in previous administrations.

**ICE tactics**:
- **Masked agents in plainclothes**, sometimes arriving in unmarked vehicles
- **Workplace raids** (Home Depot, Ambiance Apparel, etc.)
- **Target individuals who, by an overwhelming margin, pose no threat to public safety**
- **Arrests follow directive to arrest up to 3,000 immigrants each day**—a more than fourfold increase

**Impact on organizing**:
- **Many described being overwhelmed with fear and not leaving their homes**, especially as raids continued
- **Fear has a firm grip on immigrant communities**, with some families refusing to leave the house for fear of apprehension
- **Creating fear and undermining public trust**

**Translation**: Immigrants who organize face deportation. ICE doesn't care if you're organizing legally. Raids create terror that prevents organizing before it starts.

### All Organizing: You Will Be Surveilled, Infiltrated, Doxxed

**Police infiltration and surveillance**:

**Historical context (COINTELPRO)**:
- From 1956 to 1971, the FBI's COINTELPRO targeted groups the government deemed subversive, using **unconstitutional surveillance and infiltration**
- The program worked to **"expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities"** of the Black Panthers and other Black nationalist groups
- **FBI and local police agency informants did more than report on what was happening, often entrapping activists into participating in violent or illegal activities**

**Contemporary surveillance (2017-2025)**:
- **In 2017, undercover NYPD officers infiltrated groups of BLM activists** protesting the killing by police of Eric Garner, and accessed organizers' private group texts
- **Colorado Springs Police infiltrated Colorado Springs Socialists**, leading to citations and arrests for taking a march off of the sidewalk
- **Political policing emphasizes intelligence gathering using both technological surveillance and infiltration**

**Since 2017, at least twenty-one states have criminalized various aspects of peaceful protest**:
- **Florida and North Carolina consider some nonviolent blocking of streets as rioting**
- **Oklahoma enacted anti-racketeering statutes against acts of so-called unlawful assembly**

**Doxxing and online harassment**:

**Definition**: Doxxing is the internet-based practice of researching, documenting, and broadcasting private or personally identifiable information about an individual or organization **to harass and traumatize activists**.

**Tactics**:
- **Right-wing groups compile private information on leftist enemies and circulate the data to encourage harassment or violence**
- **Once doxxed, people may be targeted for**: Actual harassment in person, fake signups for mail subscriptions, food deliveries, bombarding the address with letters, or **"swatting"**—the intentional dispatching of armed police teams to a person's address

**Impact**:
- **In an era of universal surveillance**, when livestreamers broadcast every major demonstration while fascists, FBI agents, and police officers comb through social media posts to gather intelligence
- **Distrust and paranoia are a bigger problem than infiltration**, with longer-term consequences including harmed relationships with solidarity communities

**Chilling effects**:
- **Police infiltration has a chilling effect on protesters' First Amendment rights**, with fear of plainclothes police, ICE officers, and agents-provocateur discouraging would-be marchers from participating

**Translation**: Organizing is surveilled. Police infiltrate. Fascists doxx. Your personal information will be weaponized. Swatting can get you killed.

## The Nonprofit Industrial Complex: Organizing Defanged

### What the Nonprofit Model Does

**The nonprofit industrial complex is "a set of symbiotic relationships that link political and financial technologies of state and owning-class control with surveillance over public political ideology**, including and especially emergent progressive and leftist social movements."

**Workers often find that the nonprofit model rests on their own exploitation** and on preserving the political status quo.

**Many NGOs expend significant effort to convince their workers that they aren't workers in the normal sense of that word.**

**The incremental services provided by nonprofit organizations take the place of mass political organizing that could address the root of these problems—capitalism.**

### Organizer Burnout and Despair

**The contradictions of the nonprofit industry's complicity in capitalism lead not just to burnout but to outright despair.**

**Nonprofit professionals become burnt-out and are lured out by comfortable consulting fees.**

**Translation**: Nonprofits channel revolutionary energy into incremental service provision. Organizers burn out. The system absorbs dissent.

---

## Movement Infrastructure Collapse

### What Movement Infrastructure Is

**Movement infrastructure is the framing of the house** without which no plumbing or electrical can function. It includes **supporting organizers' ability to convene, to pay their staff well, to rest**, and other ways to cultivate the "strong organizations" we need.

### Why It Collapses

**Where there is good infrastructure, sometimes there are disparate abilities to access that infrastructure**, as the spontaneity that accompanies uprisings often means that organizations can be slower to support things that just "pop off."

**The spontaneity that accompanies uprisings often means that organizations can be slower to support things that just "pop off."**

**Translation**: Movements need infrastructure (money, staff, legal support, coordination). Nonprofits control that infrastructure. Nonprofits are slow, bureaucratic, and risk-averse. Uprisings happen fast. By the time nonprofits mobilize, the moment is gone.

---

## The Veil Synthesis: Why Most Organizing Fails

### Layer 1: Rational Individual Incentives (Free Rider Problem)
- "Let someone else organize. If it works, I'll benefit anyway."
- "I can't afford to risk my job/housing/immigration status."
- "My contribution won't matter in a group this large."

### Layer 2: Fear of Retaliation (Very Real)
- **Workers**: Fired, blacklisted, demoted (41.5% of union campaigns involve illegal retaliation)
- **Tenants**: Evicted, rent increased, services cut (illegal but happens constantly)
- **Immigrants**: Detained, deported (20,000/month detained, 3,000/day arrest quota)
- **All organizers**: Surveilled, infiltrated, doxxed, swatted

### Layer 3: State Repression (Legal and Illegal)
- **Legal**: 21 states criminalized aspects of peaceful protest since 2017
- **Illegal but happens**: COINTELPRO never ended, just went underground
- **Modern**: Police infiltration, doxxing, swatting, online harassment coordinated by fascists

### Layer 4: Nonprofit Capture (Dissent Defanged)
- **Nonprofits channel organizing energy into service provision**
- **Organizers burn out from nonprofit bullshit**
- **Revolutionary movements become incremental reform advocacy**

### Layer 5: Organizational Collapse (Even Successful Movements)
- **Horizontalism prevents coordination at scale**
- **External shocks destroy fragile organizations**
- **Lack of infrastructure means movements can't sustain**

## What This Means for Communiqué

### The Problem We're Actually Solving

**It's not**: "People don't know how to contact their representatives"
**It's not**: "Civic engagement needs gamification"
**It's not**: "We need better petition platforms"

**It is**:
1. **People are rationally afraid to organize** (they'll lose job/housing/immigration status)
2. **Retaliation is real and常** (even when illegal)
3. **Surveillance is ubiquitous** (police, employers, landlords, ICE, fascists)
4. **Infrastructure collapses** (movements can't sustain without it)
5. **Nonprofits defang organizing** (turn revolution into service provision)

### What Our Cryptography Actually Solves

**Not**: "Make civic engagement more shareable"

**Yes**:
1. **Anonymous organizing** (workers can sign union cards without employers knowing)
2. **Threshold signatures** (reveal only when 50%+1 reached, can't single out early organizers)
3. **Zero-knowledge proofs** (prove you're a tenant/worker without revealing identity)
4. **Encrypted coordination** (landlords/employers/ICE can't infiltrate Signal groups)
5. **Decentralized infrastructure** (can't be shut down by defunding one nonprofit)

**Translation**: Our tech directly addresses the fear that prevents organizing.

## The Real Strategy: Infrastructure to Overcome Fear

### Phase 1: Anonymity Infrastructure (Immediate)

**Problem**: Workers/tenants afraid to organize because they'll be identified and retaliated against

**Solution**:
- **Threshold signature union cards**: Workers sign anonymously, signatures revealed only when 50%+1 reached
- **ZK tenant verification**: Prove you live in building X without revealing which unit
- **Encrypted coordination**: Signal groups with TEE-based encryption (even Signal can't see who's organizing)

**Metric**: 10 organizing campaigns use our anonymity tools, 0 organizers identified before they're ready

---

### Phase 2: Retaliation Defense (3 months)

**Problem**: Even with anonymity, retaliation happens (illegal firing, eviction, detention)

**Solution**:
- **Legal support matching**: Connect fired workers to labor lawyers who've won similar cases
- **Mutual aid rapid response**: Crowdfund rent/wages for retaliated organizers within 24 hours
- **Documentation infrastructure**: Cryptographically timestamped evidence of retaliation (immutable, admissible)

**Metric**: 5 retaliated organizers get legal support + financial aid within 48 hours

---

### Phase 3: Counter-Surveillance (6 months)

**Problem**: Police/employers/landlords/ICE surveil organizing, infiltrate groups, doxx organizers

**Solution**:
- **Anti-doxing tools**: Scrub personal info from data brokers, monitor for leaks, encrypted communication
- **Infiltration detection**: Behavioral analysis to identify potential informants (using privacy-preserving ML)
- **Secure event coordination**: Anonymous RSVP, no centralized attendance list, encrypted location sharing

**Metric**: 0 successful doxing of organizers using our tools, 3 infiltrators identified and removed

---

### Phase 4: Persistent Infrastructure (12 months)

**Problem**: Movements collapse when funding dries up, organizers burn out, nonprofits defund radical work

**Solution**:
- **Decentralized mutual aid treasuries**: DAO-like structure, cryptographic consensus for fund distribution
- **Long-term relationship infrastructure**: CRM for organizing (tracks relationships over years, not weeks)
- **Victory documentation**: What actually worked, preserved cryptographically, can't be memory-holed

**Metric**: 3 organizing campaigns sustain for >2 years using our infrastructure, 0 collapse from funding cuts

## The Brutal Honesty

### What Won't Work

**Won't work**:
- Petition platforms (powerless)
- Congressional message campaigns (ignored)
- Social media slacktivism (performative)
- Gamification (doesn't address fear)
- Viral moments (don't sustain)

**Why**: These don't solve the core problem. **People don't organize because they're afraid of retaliation, not because organizing isn't fun enough.**

### What Might Work

**Might work**:
- Anonymous union card signing (solves fear of firing)
- ZK tenant organizing (solves fear of eviction)
- Encrypted immigrant coordination (solves fear of deportation)
- Counter-surveillance tools (solves fear of infiltration/doxxing)
- Decentralized infrastructure (solves nonprofit capture)

**Why**: These directly address the barriers. **Make organizing safer, and people will organize.**

---

## The Uncomfortable Questions

### 1. Are we building for victories or martyrs?

KC tenants won after 247 days. Brooklyn tenants won after 4 years. **How many lost?** How many were evicted during the strike and gave up? How many were blacklisted and can't rent anywhere now?

**Our tools need to**:
- Minimize casualties (anonymous organizing)
- Support casualties when they happen (mutual aid, legal support)
- Document what worked (so next campaign learns from both wins and losses)

### 2. Are we building for the organized or the unorganized?

KC Tenants is an existing organization. AFL-CIO is an existing organization. **They have infrastructure, legal teams, strike funds.**

**Most people trying to organize have**:
- No organization
- No lawyers
- No money
- No experience
- No time (working 2 jobs)

**Our tools need to work for**:
- First-time organizers (not just experienced campaigns)
- Low-resource contexts (not just well-funded movements)
- High-risk populations (immigrants, prisoners, not just citizens with legal protections)

### 3. Are we prepared for the backlash?

**If our tools actually work**, landlords/employers/ICE will:
- Try to shut us down legally (DMCA, ToS violations, "facilitating illegal activity")
- Try to infiltrate us (police, fascists as users)
- Try to dox/swat us (we're organizers too)
- Try to defund us (payment processors, hosting providers)

**Are we prepared to**:
- Decentralize (so we can't be shut down)
- Stay anonymous ourselves (so we can't be targeted)
- Accept legal risk (we're building tools for illegal-but-just organizing)
- Be despised by power (landlords, employers, police, ICE, fascists will hate us)

### 4. What if cryptography isn't enough?

**Cryptography solves**:
- Anonymity (ZK proofs, threshold signatures)
- Privacy (encryption)
- Trust without identity (cryptographic reputation)

**Cryptography doesn't solve**:
- Organizer burnout (still need to show up to meetings for years)
- Free rider problem (still rational not to participate)
- State violence (raids still happen even if you're anonymous)
- Economic coercion (still need rent money even if landlord doesn't know you're organizing)

**We also need**:
- Mutual aid (economic support)
- Political education (why organize despite risks)
- Community (so organizing isn't lonely)
- Victories (to prove it's worth it)

---

## Conclusion: Build for the Darkness

**WHAT-ACTUALLY-WORKS.md** showed the victories. This doc shows why most organizing fails.

**Both are true.**

Organizing CAN work (KC, Brooklyn, Toronto, Boeing, Starbucks, Missouri ballot initiative). But most organizing DOESN'T work (crushed by retaliation, surveillance, burnout, free-riding, collapse).

**The question isn't "can organizing work?"**
**The question is: "Can we build infrastructure that makes organizing work MORE OFTEN?"**

**Our answer**:
1. **Anonymity tools** (overcome fear of retaliation)
2. **Retaliation defense** (support casualties)
3. **Counter-surveillance** (prevent infiltration/doxxing)
4. **Persistent infrastructure** (prevent collapse)

**But we need to be honest**:
- This won't be easy
- We'll be targeted
- Most campaigns will still fail
- People will still get hurt

**The only question is**: Is reducing casualties and increasing win rate enough?

**Or do we need to aim higher?**

I think we need to aim higher. But first, we need to survive.

**Build tools that keep organizers alive.**

Then build tools that help them win.
