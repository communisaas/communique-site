# Communique Docs

**Democracy infrastructure that competes in the attention economy.**

While memecoins hit $40B in 24 hours, civic engagement reads like homework. Communique transforms political participation into instant action that spreads like viral content.

**What this is**: Instant civic action infrastructure, globally.

- **One click, real impact**: Contact representatives in seconds, not hours
- **Global delivery**: US Congress (CWC) today, Westminster tomorrow, new governance forms beyond
- **Viral by design**: Templates that spread through networks like memes
- **VOTER Protocol powered**: Every action earns rewards, builds reputation, creates accountability
- **On-chain verification**: Anchored on Monad with ERC-8004 portable reputation

The US Congressional API is our proof of concept. Parliamentary systems are next. Any governance structure that accepts citizen input can integrate.
