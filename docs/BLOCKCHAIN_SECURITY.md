# Blockchain Security - Production Readiness

**Current Status**: ✅ **WEEK 1 COMPLETE** - Critical security fixes implemented
**Target**: 5-week security remediation before real users
**Completion**: 100% of Week 1 Critical Tasks Complete (4/4)

---

## 🔒 Security-First Approach

Following a comprehensive security audit, we identified critical vulnerabilities in our initial blockchain integration. **We have stopped all production deployment** and are systematically addressing every security concern.

**We will NOT launch with real users until all critical security fixes are complete and externally audited.**

---

## ✅ What's Been Fixed (Week 1)

### 1. Hot Wallet Eliminated
- **Before**: Server held private keys, signed all transactions (custodial)
- **After**: Server is READ-ONLY, users sign with passkeys (non-custodial)
- **Impact**: Eliminated single point of compromise

### 2. Privacy-Leaking Account IDs Fixed
- **Before**: `google-abc123.communique.testnet` (linkable to real identity)
- **After**: `random-a3f2d9c8.communique.testnet` (not linkable)
- **Impact**: Users cannot be doxxed via blockchain data

### 3. Passkey Authentication Implemented
- **Technology**: NEAR biometric authentication (WebAuthn/FIDO2)
- **UX**: Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello
- **Security**: Private keys never leave device secure enclave
- **Impact**: True self-custody of funds and identity

### 4. Social Recovery & User Sovereignty Implemented
- **Mechanism**: 2-of-3 guardian approval for account recovery
- **Portability**: Full account export to any NEAR wallet
- **Recovery**: Users can recover accounts if device is lost
- **Migration**: Complete migration guide at [`docs/migration.md`](./migration.md)
- **Impact**: Users truly own their accounts, can migrate off Communique

## ⏳ What's Coming Next

### Week 2: Infrastructure Hardening
- **RPC Failover**: Multiple endpoints, automatic failover
- **IPFS Metadata**: Private data encrypted, public data on IPFS
- **Impact**: More resilient, better privacy

### Week 3: Transparency & Documentation
- **Trust Model Documentation**: Honest disclosure of MPC assumptions
- **Messaging Updates**: Remove misleading "non-custodial" claims
- **Impact**: Users understand exactly what they're getting

### Week 4: Privacy Features
- **Pseudonymous Mode**: Privacy by default
- **ZK District Verification**: Prove residency without revealing address
- **Impact**: Maximum privacy for civic actions

### Week 5: Security Audit
- **External Audit**: Professional security assessment
- **Penetration Testing**: Adversarial testing
- **Final Verification**: All checklist items complete
- **Impact**: Production-ready certification

## 🎯 Production Readiness Criteria

### Must Complete Before Launch:
- ✅ No private keys on server
- ✅ Privacy-safe account IDs
- ✅ Passkey authentication working
- ✅ Social recovery implemented
- ⏳ RPC failover tested
- ⏳ Metadata privacy verified
- ⏳ Trust model documented
- ⏳ External audit complete (0 critical findings)
- ⏳ Penetration testing passed
- ✅ User sovereignty verified

**Current Score**: 5/10 complete (50%)

---

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
**Reason**: Week 1 critical fixes complete, but infrastructure hardening and privacy features remain.

### Target Risk Level: 🟢 **LOW**
**Requirements**:
- All 10 production criteria met
- External audit complete
- 2 weeks of testnet validation
- Disaster recovery plan tested

---

## 🔍 What Was Wrong?

### Original Architecture Problems:
1. **Custodial masquerading as non-custodial**
   - Server held private keys (hot wallet)
   - Claimed to be "self-sovereign" but wasn't

2. **Privacy nightmare**
   - Account IDs linked to real identities
   - Personal data stored on public blockchain

3. **Single points of failure**
   - One RPC endpoint
   - No failover or redundancy

4. **No user sovereignty**
   - Users couldn't export keys
   - Couldn't migrate to other wallets
   - Accounts would be orphaned if Communique shut down

### Why This Happened:
- Rapid prototyping without security review
- Misunderstanding of MPC custody models
- Insufficient privacy analysis
- No external audit before deployment

---

## 🛡️ How We're Fixing It

### 1. Security-First Development
- Every change reviewed for security implications
- "Assume breach" mindset
- Multiple layers of defense

### 2. External Validation
- Hired security auditors (Week 5)
- Penetration testing
- Privacy impact assessments

### 3. Honest Communication
- No misleading marketing claims
- Clear disclosure of trust assumptions
- Transparent about MPC custody model

### 4. User Sovereignty
- Social recovery mechanism
- Export functionality
- Migration documentation
- Works even if Communique shuts down

## 🚨 If You Find Security Issues

**DO NOT open a public issue.**

Instead:
1. Email: security@communi.email
2. Use GitHub private security advisories
3. Signal: [secure contact]

We take security seriously and will respond within 24 hours.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What We Did Wrong:
1. Shipped without external security review
2. Used misleading "non-custodial" terminology
3. Didn't understand MPC custody trade-offs
4. Prioritized speed over security

### What We're Doing Right Now:
1. Stopped everything to fix security
2. Hired external auditors
3. Being brutally honest about architecture
4. Documenting everything
5. Not rushing to production

### What We'll Do Differently:
1. Security review before any blockchain code ships
2. External audit for all critical systems
3. Honest communication about trade-offs
4. User sovereignty as non-negotiable requirement

## ✅ Current Production Status

**Testnet Only**: All blockchain features are on NEAR testnet and Scroll Sepolia.

**Mainnet Transition**: Will NOT happen until all 10 production criteria are met.

**User Impact**: Current users experiencing zero blockchain features until security is complete. This is intentional.
