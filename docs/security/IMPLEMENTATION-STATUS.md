## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### What We're Building (Correct)

**PII Storage:**
- ✅ NEAR CipherVault (decentralized blockchain)
- ✅ XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption
- ✅ Sovereign keys (user controlled)
- ✅ Poseidon commitments for ZK proofs
- ✅ No corporate custody

**PostgreSQL (Public/Pseudonymous Data Only):**
- ✅ Template text (public)
- ✅ NEAR account IDs (`random-a3f2d9c8.communique.testnet`)
- ✅ Scroll addresses (`0xABCD...1234`)
- ✅ CipherVault envelope references
- ✅ Metadata, timestamps, counts
- ✅ Reputation scores (mirrored from on-chain)

**Scroll Blockchain (Settlement):**
- ✅ Reputation (ERC-8004)
- ✅ ZK proof verifications
- ✅ Challenge markets
- ✅ Outcome markets
- ✅ Token rewards

**NEAR Blockchain (Account Management + Storage):**
- ✅ Passkey authentication (WebAuthn)
- ✅ Chain Signatures (multi-chain control)
- ✅ CipherVault (encrypted PII storage)
- ✅ Guardian recovery

### What We're NOT Building (Violations Prevented)

**❌ Corporate Database Encryption:**
- ❌ NOT storing encrypted PII in PostgreSQL
- ❌ NOT using AES-256-GCM for PII
- ❌ NOT keeping `encryption_metadata` in Supabase
- ❌ NOT building surveillance infrastructure with crypto on top

**Why This Matters:**
- Supabase = Corporate entity = Subpoena target
- NEAR = Decentralized blockchain = No corporate custody
- Architectural privacy > Encrypted surveillance

## 📝 Key Learnings

### What Went Wrong

1. **Misinterpreted bootstrap docs** as final architecture
2. **Built temporary measure** (PostgreSQL encryption) as permanent solution
3. **Didn't verify against VOTER Protocol** before implementing

### What Went Right

1. **User caught violation** before production launch
2. **Removed cleanly** - no technical debt left
3. **RPC work was valuable** - correct architecture, production-ready
4. **Week 1 security fixes** were correct and aligned

### How We're Preventing Future Mistakes

1. **Read architecture docs first** - Don't extrapolate from bootstrap guides
2. **Verify against protocol principles** - Every implementation decision
3. **Question misalignments early** - If it feels wrong, it probably is
4. **Weekly architecture reviews** - Catch violations before code is written
