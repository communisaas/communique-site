# Communique Voice & Language Guide

**Clear communication for democratic participation**

The way we communicate shapes how citizens understand their civic power. Our language must be direct, trustworthy, and empowering without being presumptuous. Every word choice reinforces that this platform treats civic engagement as serious, impactful work.

## Core Voice Principles

### **Democratic Authority Without Arrogance**

We speak with the confidence of a platform that understands legislative processes, but never talk down to users or oversell our influence.

**Good**: "Representatives track constituent communication carefully. Your message will be recorded in their system."

**Bad**: "Here's how Congress works..." or "Your message will definitely change policy."

### **Immediate Clarity Over Marketing Language**

Citizens need to understand exactly what's happening with their civic actions. Clear, direct language reduces anxiety and builds trust.

**Good**: "Message delivered to Representative Smith's office via Congressional system. Delivery confirmed at 2:47 PM."

**Bad**: "Your voice is being heard!" or "Message sent successfully!"

### **Empowering Without Overpromising**

We help citizens understand their impact potential without making claims we can't substantiate.

**Good**: "This template has been cited in 3 legislative speeches and influenced 2 floor votes."

**Bad**: "This template will change everything" or "Make your voice heard."

## Civic Action Language

### **Message Delivery Communication**

**Channel-Specific Delivery**

- Both: "Routed through both Congressional and district channels"

**Delivery Confirmation**
- "Delivery confirmed by Congressional system at [timestamp]"
- "Message received by Representative [Name]'s office"
- "Automatic receipt generated - message logged in official system"

**Delivery Issues**
- "Congressional system temporarily unavailable. We'll retry automatically."
- "Representative's office mailbox is full. Trying alternate delivery method."

### **Verification Language**

**Address Verification**
- "Address verified with postal records"
- "Confirms you're in Representative [Name]'s district"  
- "Required for Congressional delivery system access"

**Identity Verification**
- "Identity confirmed - all civic features unlocked"
- "Verification prevents automated abuse of legislative systems"
- "One-time verification enables lifetime civic participation"

**Process Status**
- "Verifying your address with postal service..." (not "Checking if you're real")
- "Confirming district assignment..." (not "Finding your representative")
- "Enabling Congressional delivery access..." (not "Setting up your account")

### **Template and Impact Language**

## Error Communication

### **Helpful Error Messages**

Civic engagement errors can be frustrating. Our messaging should be immediately actionable and respectful of citizens' time.

**Address Issues**
- **Problem**: "Your representative's office requires a verified address."
- **Solution**: "We'll help you add one. This takes about 2 minutes."
- **Context**: "Required by Congressional security protocols."

**Verification Problems**  
- **Problem**: "We couldn't verify your address with postal records."
- **Solution**: "Try using the exact format from your voter registration or utility bill."
- **Assistance**: "Or contact support - we verify manually within 24 hours."

**Delivery Failures**
- **Problem**: "Message delivery failed because the Congressional server is down."
- **Automatic**: "We'll retry automatically every 15 minutes."
- **Alternative**: "We can also send via the representative's district office."

**Template Issues**
- **Problem**: "This template contains information that couldn't be verified."
- **Guidance**: "Review the highlighted sections and add sources where possible."
- **Context**: "Verified information gets priority routing to Congressional staff."

### **Error Prevention Language**

**Form Validation**
- "Congressional system requires your full legal name" (not "Name is required")
- "Use the address format from your voter registration" (not "Invalid address")  
- "Messages under 100 characters rarely generate responses" (not "Message too short")

**Proactive Guidance**
- "Representatives respond better to specific local examples"
- "Personal stories perform 3x better than generic requests"
- "Templates with sources are more likely to influence votes"

## International Adaptation

### **Parliamentary Systems**

**UK Parliament Adaptation**
- "Message delivered to MP's Westminster office"
- "Routed through Parliament's contact system"  
- "Your voice recorded in parliamentary correspondence"

**Canadian Parliament**
- "Sent to MP's Ottawa and constituency offices"
- "Bilingual delivery (English/French) when requested"
- "Added to parliamentary correspondence records"

**EU Parliament**
- "Delivered to MEP's Brussels and home-country offices"
- "Multi-language routing based on your preference"
- "Recorded in European Parliament correspondence system"

### **Cultural Sensitivity**

**Formal vs. Informal Address**
- US: "Representative Smith" (formal but accessible)
- UK: "Your MP" or "Member of Parliament" (institutional respect)  
- Canada: "Your Member of Parliament" (full formal title)

**Governmental Language**
- Avoid terms that assume specific political systems
- Use "legislative office" rather than "Congressional office" internationally
- Adapt "representative" to "member," "deputy," "delegate" as appropriate

## Tone Examples by Context

### **First-Time User Onboarding**

**Welcoming but not overwhelming**
"Congress tracks millions of messages each year. We help yours stand out by ensuring verified delivery and providing templates that have influenced actual votes."

**Not**: "Welcome to the future of civic engagement!" or "Democracy has never been easier!"

### **Power User Features**

**Respectful of experience**
"You've sent 15 verified messages this year. Advanced features like template creation and impact tracking are now available in your dashboard."

**Not**: "Congrats on being a civic champion!" or gamified language

### **Error Recovery**

**Solution-oriented**
"The Congressional system is temporarily down. We'll deliver your message automatically once it's restored, or you can use direct outreach to reach staff immediately."

**Not**: "Oops!" or "Something went wrong"

### **Policy Impact Communication**

**Factual attribution**
"Your template's economic data was cited by Rep. Johnson in floor speech on H.R. 247. The amendment using this information passed 247-186."

**Not**: "You changed a law!" or overstated impact claims

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Dynamic Content**

**Personalization Variables**
- `{representativeName}` - Always include full title
- `{districtDescription}` - "your district" or "the 4th District"  
- `{deliveryMethod}` - "Congressional system" or "district office"
- `{responseTimeframe}` - Based on office's historical response pattern

**Contextual Messaging**
```javascript
// Good: Context-aware messaging
if (deliveryChannel === 'congressional') {
  message = `Delivered via ${chamber} contact system`
} else {
  message = `Sent to ${representative}'s district office`
}

// Bad: Generic messaging  
message = "Message sent successfully"
```

### **Accessibility Considerations**

**Screen Reader Compatibility**
- Always provide context: "Message delivery status: Delivered"  
- Use proper heading hierarchy for information architecture
- Include landmark regions: `role="main"`, `role="navigation"`

**Plain Language Compliance**
- Average 8th-grade reading level for general content
- Technical terms explained on first use
- Short sentences for complex civic processes

### **A/B Testing Framework**

**Test Categories**
- **Clarity**: Do users understand what's happening?
- **Trust**: Does the language increase completion rates?
- **Action**: Does the messaging drive intended behavior?

**Success Metrics**
- Form completion rates
- Error recovery success
- User satisfaction scores  
- Civic action follow-through rates
