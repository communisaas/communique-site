/**
 * Activation Components - Perceptual Engineering
 *
 * The activation surface pattern replaces the traditional "hero + content" layout
 * with an immediately actionable interface where both primary affordances
 * (creation and browsing) are visible and accessible without abstract buttons.
 *
 * Components:
 * - CreationSpark: Inline creation entry point (visible writing surface)
 * - CoordinationExplainer: Collapsible "how it works" with RelayLoom
